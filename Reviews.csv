I'm even cutting it with more water or coffee than directed because it is, as almost all of the proteins have been, very strong in flavor.  But, this is a flavor I can stand.  And no icky smell.  I loved my flavored drinks from the coffee houses as well as flavored creamers that I used at home in my coffee.  This pretty much does it for me.

Does NOT taste like a protein shake!,"First of all, as with ALL protein shakes, you really should test out different amounts of water vs. powder to see what tastes best to you.  I have discovered that I typically like a more watery shake (less powder) than what the manufacturers recommend.  Some people can look at this as a negative, since you would need to drink 2x the liquid to get the same nutritional value for ""one serving,"" but if you're trying to loose weight, sipping throughout the day isn't a bad thing.  As far as this shake goes, using two full scoops taste like a strong version of International Foods Sugar Free Vanilla Latte Instant Coffee.  Anyway, here is what works for me:    1.  16oz cold water & a few ice cubes  2.  one scoop of Click powder  3.  Combine in my 20oz Venti Starbucks reusable cold-cup.  Put lid on without straw, place finger over hole for straw, shake vigorously. Remove lid, replace straw, ENJOY!    In my opinion, drinking this shake this way is REALLY delicious and taste just like iced coffee. It does NOT have the typical protein shake flavor and aftertaste at all.

I first must admit I'm a 20-something guy who has tried a number of protein products in my day, some good, most bad to terrible. My personal favorite is muscle milk light due to its flavor and ease of mixing. After trying Click, I can't imagine a better protein drink early in the morning. The flavor is excellent (I prefer Vanilla Latte over Mocha personally) and it mixes with ease. Great in water or milk. Recently I've been blending it in the morning with Almond Milk and a few ice cubes and it's awesome. I usually don't like Vanilla Latte drinks at Starbucks because the vanilla is overpowering but not with this mix.  It's really not even accurate to call it ""Vanilla Latte"". I think its just an improved Mocha flavor, which is what I'd prefer. 15 grams of protein in the morning helps curb your appetite and its also low in sugar in fat which is usually a problem with protein drinks.  Biggest problem I can find is that Click is clearly being marketed towards women given the bright pink/purple canister and female stick figure on the label.  Honestly, this is a product that both health conscience men and women should be happy to use in the morning. Right now I don't know another company that is offering a product like this (Muscle Milk has a coffee flavor but it's not as good) and given how important breakfast is to a healthy diet and a weight loss plan, Click is a great addition to your pantry. The price is fair, especially since you'll get a discount through Amazon.  If your interested in losing weight, give Click a try. It's less than you'll pay for a week of bagels and coffee at Starbucks and a whole lot healthier for you."

I have only tried the vanilla flavor and it has been wonderful.  The idea behind me taking this protein drink is actually two-fold.  The first is to not eliminate but lower my coffee drinking addiciton (i.e. starbucks use ot be a morning ritual!) and also because it has some calories but not too many, I've been using it as a meal replacement for breakfast time.  I'm trying to lose weight, and this is helping me get closer to my goal weight.    Since each serving is only 100 calories, you should be prepared for that you will feel hungry about an hour after you drink it.  I started taking Yohimbine Powder, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XOUOA4"">5 Grams Yohimbine HCL 99% Bulk Powder</a> shortly after starting to drink these shakes, and if you are trying to cut back on calories, I highly recommend some kind of natural appetite suppressant, you have no idea the difference it makes, basically a life-saver for me as I'm what you would call a snacker of snacks!    I know some other reviewers have said that stiring the mix works for them but I'm sorry if you really want to enjoy this shake, you need a blender, plain and simple.  I could sit there in my kitchen and stir for an hour and it still won't taste nearly as good compared to blending it for thirty seconds."

And, completely ignoring the fact that my espresso machine is dead, this was the perfect day to try it out.    As with any CLICK protein flavor - the suggested method of serving is to add the protein powder to 12-14 ounces of water, and mix well either cold, or warm it up.  I added 14 ounces of steaming water from my hot tap on the water dispenser.    It was lighter in color than the Mocha Flavored CLICK, more like a cappuccino.  It even frothed, but that could have been from the psycho blending I do to it.  It definitely tastes like a vanilla latte, perhaps not the way I order it (Hi there extra shots!) but very taste-friendly to the espresso virgin.     The verdict.  HELL YES.  Thank you CLICK, I loves it.    Product - CLICK Espresso Protein Powder Vanilla Latte Flavor  Price - Amazon varies.

If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!    Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.    My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!    As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, ""Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink.""  I fully recommend this to anyone!!    Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.    Enjoy!"

That's a lot of additional cost and calories.  I decided to give Click a try and purchased both the Mocha and the Vanilla Latte.  I'm hooked on the Vanilla Latte.  The Mocha was too sweet and heavy feeling for me, but my husband loved it.    I use a Magic Bullet...load the cup with ice and WATER (yes, just water) to 1 inch from top, add my two scoops of Click, and blend.

I love it more than the mocha flavor, it seems smoother and it doesn't have as strong of coffee taste to it either.  I love the smell of the vanilla when you open the canister, but thankfully it does NOT have an overpowering sweet vanilla taste to it.  I actually prefer my Click Vanilla Latte to the ""[...]"" v. latte--it's great.  I am so thankful for both Click products, it helps me get my daily protein requirements each day, it has helped me reach my weight loss goals, and it gives me a little kick of energy in the afternoons when I need it and I don't know what I would do without it to start my mornings.  Do yourself a favor and Click!    p.s. I wish Amazon sold the ""CLICK"" shaker cup --it's my favorite shaker cup too but I don't want to pay the S & H to get another one -that makes it too expensive!  Although if I lost mine I would probably break down and buy it anyway..."

Decent protein (15g). All of this with a 31g/2 scoop serving.  And, most importantly, superb taste PLUS a caffeine kick for workout momentum. You just cannot lose with CLICK, whether it's the Mocha or newest Vanilla Latte flavor.

I didn't think Vanilla Latte could measure up to the Mocha and boy, was I wrong.  The vanilla is a sweet smooth flavor with a hint of caramel in the background. It is not the cloying fake vanilla and sweetness overload I have experienced with other vanilla flavored proteins.  It dissolves perfectly, has caffeine, and doesn't have that offensive sour protein shake smell, either.

So I added  1 click scoop, 1 cup milk, (some plain vanilla whey protein to increase my protein intake and keep sugars stabilized longer)  then a 1/2 cup of my decaf espresso cold brewed coffee I keep handy in the fridge, a couple of ice cubes, shake some more. OH - it was heavenly.    I have enjoyed the mocha - however typically I'm more of a coffee flavor girl, and pure vanilla go together better on my palette.  I love chocolate, love coffee - together not so much my thing. The Mocha Click though works well together, and I have enjoyed it but wished for a more coffee flavor Click.

It's my vice. I love espresso drinks and coffee. And spend far too much $ at my local coffee shop I have frequented for 10 years. Usually the first thing in the a.m. on my list is to brew a pot of coffee and mix a soy protein shake from GNC. But not here lately. Now first thing I do after my feet hit the floor is to pour 10 oz of milk into the handy shaker and mix 2 scoops of Click, shake it up and voila. It's delicious! (Did I mention I no longer brew coffee in the a.m.?)  Another important factor for me is that I don't eat meat. I am a Pescetarian. So, as a rule, I don't get enough protein in my diet. That's probably one of the reasons I drink so much coffee, is because my energy wanes during the day. I used to get a stomach ache daily that I just sort of got used to - was it too much coffee on an empty stomach or the soy in the protein shake from GNC?? Who knows.  What I do know is that today, for example, I drank two Click shakes back to back with my supplements I take every a.m. (Omega 3, multi, Acai, B complex...) and I feel great. No stomach ache, no jitters, energetic and content.  I would highly recommend this product. I've just ordered two more canisters! Enjoy!"

I've used it in the morning when I don't have time to brew coffee (or eat) and have to run out the door.

Now when it comes to getting protein in, that has been a challenge.  Most protein powders have a terrible taste and smell to them making it less than desireable to drink.  With Click Mocha, I add it to a cup of milk, half cup of water, ice cubes into a blender shaker bottle with a scoop of protein powder (such as EAS or Syntrax Chocolate or vanilla) and one Click scoop of Click - two scoops is a serving.  Shake it up and go, this is my morning routine every single morning. And I do mean every single morning.  I am NOT a breakfast eater, so this helps me get some protein in and lasts me until I'm either ready to eat breakfast or lunch depending on the time.    The coffee flavor is not strong in the mocha,  so I do add some instant decaf espresso ( I try to limit my caffine daily, if your not limiting your caffine then add leaded instant espresso) Bustello is my decaf instant espresso of choice and is more economical than Starbucks Decaf Via (Got a box of this for my birthday so I have tried using half a serving and still get AWESOME coffee flavor)    If I just want a little afternoon pick up, I will use cold brewed coffee and add some milk and a half a scoop of click to make my iced coffee creamier.

I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.    I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot.

Yes, there's that vitamin taste, but that's the nature of shakes like this.    The Caffeine:  I usually eat this with my lunch to give me the added boost I need to make it to my 530pm class and back home.  I tried having it for dinner one night.  Bad idea.  I was up until 3am.  Yes, there's plenty of caffeine in there but I won't drink it after 1pm.    The fill-up factor:  Fiber is the best filler.  Protein is great with those who have to watch their glycemic level.  I developed gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with my twins and was borderline diabetic at one point.  I NEED protein in high amounts to keep my blood glucose levels at an even keel.  This works.  It staves hunger and has the fiber and protein to help me forget about being hungry for an hour or two.    I would recommend this to those who are looking for a way to stave hunger or get caffeine with added vitamins and/or protein.    I would also suggest getting a mixer bottle with the wire wisk ball.

But if I'm going to write a review about anything...CLICK is it. If you like coffee, strong coffee like Starbuck Coffee, you'll LOVE CLICK Mocha Double Cappuccino. It's strong, but without the choking bitterness of too strong coffee. CLICK makes a perfect morning wake up, and I've been a ""gotta have a pot of coffee to wake-up"" person for many years. CLICK is great! Two scoops, stir it around in your cup...zap it in the micro for 1 minute, stir again...another 30 seconds, and all done...simply perfect eye opener. I drink this first, while my pot of coffee is brewing, and within 15 minutes I'm human again. No guilt either, because this has 15 grams of protein and all your vitamins and good stuff to get you going. It's like one of those trendy 1 oz. power shots, but only better because it's also a meal replacement.  After buying two canisters at my physician's office for 24.00 apiece, 16.00 per canister (plus free shipping) when you buy from Amazon scheduled shipping, is quite a deal. That averages less than 1.25 per serving, far less expensive than a Starbucks daily, or even a local fast food coffee. That's my justification anyway...and I'm sticking to it :-)  Coffee and Chocolate...who could ask for more!  ~Nonna-Deb"

It gives me the caffine shot I want and the Protein I need and it is yummy.    I know that a few people have said that it was difficult to mix.  I use one of those mixing bottles with the little metal whirly ball in it and it mixes in seconds without any problems.  The final drink is rich and flavorfull and not at all thick.  It has that smooth creamy texture of a mocha latte.    I have, on occasion, added sugar free vanilla flavoring, but usually I am in such a hurry that I just mix and drink.  It is the perfect breakfast for someone on a tight schedule.    I recommend this to all of my friends and have even handed out samples.

I shook it another minute, still chunky. Added a bit more milk, shook another minute - still chunky. Fortunately the chunks are very tasty. Tomorrow I will try it in the blender and see how that works out. If I don't like it I think I will have to invest in the shaker cup with the mixing ball because I'm sure I will be drinking this every day.

I think that would fall under the category of ""unreasonable expectations"". But if for some reason, you must supplement your protein intake artificially (as I must), this is a very nice option. I frankly can't begin to understand the complaints here about it being hard to prepare. I add two scoops to about a third of a cup cold, nonfat milk, stir it smooth (just using a spoon, with no problem), fill the rest of the mug with water and nuke it until it's drinking-range hot.  Note: Do not heat it to near boiling and then sit it by you to slowly cool as you sip, like you might with a real coffee drink. Too much heat curdles protein, powders, and *yuck!* (I think this is what's been happening to those who complain of its lumpiness, or ""boogery"" texture.) Just heat up it to the temperature that feels comfortable to drink.    I really look forward to my Click every morning, just as I used to with my morning coffee.

After my early morning workout it gives me my vitamins, minerals and most important the espresso boost I need to jump start my day.

565676,B002GKEK7G,AVAW0HU8BXXKT,zemes,1,1,3,1266278400,Too sweet and messy,"The taste: B+    This drink is quite tasty. It isn't the best instant coffee drink I've ever had, but close.    But it is way too sweet for my taste. I put only one scoop (instead of the recommended two scoops) in a glass of water, and it is still too sweet. But this comes from me who usually drink black coffee, so may be just my personal preference.    The fact that this drink uses primarily fructose instead of glucose doesn't help either. The recent studies show that fructose is ""more bad"" than glucose due to heart disease and diabetes concerns. (I provided a scientific link here, but it was edited out by Amazon. But you can search on the Internet.)    Primarily because of the sweetness, this drink is enjoyable at the beginning, but by the time you have had just a few sips, it becomes tiring, as if the only remaining dominating flavor is its sweetness, and there is very little other fragrance left. In contrast, a good espresso or latte drink maintains a strong fragrance all the way.    However, it is an energy drink, so it is unfair to compare it with espresso or latte on the taste department. I'm just reviewing on this so readers may have proper expectations.    The convenience: C+    You shouldn't buy this just for its convenience, which is lacking for this product. It isn't easy to prepare this drink at all. For a hot drink, for example, it takes many steps, including mixing, shaking, microwave, stirring, microwave again, and shaking again. It isn't terribly difficult to do if you really want to have the drink, but frankly, I find it easier to prepare real espresso on my automatic espresso machine.    In addition, it can be quite a messy experience to have this drink. Must be because it's a protein drink, the container becomes very dirty and very difficult to clean even if you try to clean it right away.    The nutrition: Don't know. Supposedly good.    But to be fair, I believe most people buy this product for healthy reasons, not for its sheer taste or convenience. I'm not exactly sure how it performs in the energy department, as I have no trustworthy way to measure, but the nutritional ingredients in this drink would indicate that it is far more nutritious than regular coffee."

Before purchasing I had been using another whey protein powder that was NOT very tasty, but none of them ever are, they are just a recovery drink for after I run. So, I was curious to see if this one would be any different as so many were saying.    They are right, it has a wonderful strong coffee taste, not bitter, no aftertaste and I had no problems with mixing it in the CLICK shaker that I purchased with this.  I like the size of the CLICK shaker, its small & measures easily ~ my other shaker for the health food store is too big. I'm not sure why others say it doesn't mix well, since I had no problems.  I did try to put it in my coffee to see how it would taste & it was a no go. It did not mix in hot coffee very well, but then again, that's not what it's meant for. I do use room temp bottled water when mixing, as I am a freak of nature & do not care for cold water, but, for the review, I chilled after mixing & it stayed mixed up and maintained it's great flavor. If you add PB2 expected very small ""nutty"" residue to remain from the PB2 and not from the CLICK. This is not an issue, just worth mentioning.    Energy rush is not so prevalent for me, but I can see where someone could be speeded up with this drink, so if you high blood pressure I do not recommend this. I do NOT recommend this for kids or teens because of that fact. I just like the good coffee taste in my protein drink. I do recommend the PB2 for a healthy additive to this protein drink as well."

So when I happened upon this coffee extract at a local store and realized it was simply pure extract of coffee, with nothing added, I bought the one bottle they had.    Wow! The stuff is exquisitely good. For lunch I often make myself a protein and fruit ""shake"" with a banana, apple, homemade yogurt, an egg, a little orange juice -- and a tiny shot of this extract (a little goes a long way), all topped with a sprinkle of nutmeg. The extract adds amazing and complex coffee flavor: rich with simultaneously subtle overtones. Though I no longer eat wheat or other grains either, I CAN imagine how good this would be in cake or other baked goods. (I intend to try it in a couple of the nut-flour based baked items I make, using it instead of almond extract.)    This is the only Bakto Flavor extract I've tried (so far). But based on how good it is, I certainly intend to try more of them. And I very much appreciate that they have no additives, and especially not sugar (or alchohol).

Outrageous!!**    These brown rice cakes are one of the best sources of clean carbohydrates you'll find. Nothing but brown rice. They are also great because they are ready to eat out of the package. Anyone that's concerned about their diet knows that it's difficult to find clean carbs that are low on the glycemic index and that is convenient to eat. This is one of the only items that really covers all those bases. In fact, talk to any serious bodybuilder (they are the most extreme dieters of all the athletes) and they will tell you that these are a staple of their diet, especially when they're prepping for a show.    Some people here complain about the fact that they crumble. That is due to the fact that there is nothing in them to make them stick together! In fact, I'm surprised that they stick together at all.    Others say that they don't taste that great and that they're bland. Well, again; it's just brown rice! Nothing more.    If you're looking for something that tastes fantastic and that sticks together like glue, get some rice crispy treats. But, if you want clean carbs that are low on the glycemic index, and that are convenient and ready to eat, this stuff is pretty much the best there is."

The bar is a mix of dried fruit, brown rice crisps, and hemp nuts, and the flavors of these manage to remain relatively distinct as the bar has not been blended into a homogenous mass. (unlike many other bars on the market)    The Coconut Mango Papaya Alpsnack is my favorite, but the other flavors are good too.  I usually eat Banana or Apple Lara bars, but Lara bars are heavy on dates, and have a dense sticky texuture.  Alpsnacks provide a nice change, and can stave off hunger for a long time.  This is likely due to the high protein content of hemp nuts.    The Alpsnack's biggest fault might be the texture, which is not fully crunchy - semi soft rice crisps aren't ideal, and the bars are mildly crumbly - but I think this a natural result of the Alpsnack being a packaged product.  Additionally, the flavor is a bit unusual, probably due to the hemp nuts.

This is my second Barbaresco kit; the first is not yet ready to bottle (~80 days since fermentation began), but already tastes very nice for such a young wine. This kit may end up producing better wine than the Amarone. My only qualm is that the labels they ship with the kit say ""Barbera"".

I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, ""normal"" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.    This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.    My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!)

It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect.

I am therefore frugal by design, because I do like to save a little of what I make.  That means that I rarely buy my lunch in the company-sponsored cafeteria, or at a local (sit down or take-out) restaurant.  I bring my lunch to work every day in the guise of Campbell's Chunky Soup in an 18.6 oz can.    Campbell's Chunky Soup comes in a number of different varieties not all of which I enjoy, but I do enjoy most, including Campbell's ""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta,"" the subject of this review.  The soup brand, whose tag line used to be ""so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,""  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber.    ""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta"" contains (2) servings with 100 calories and 2 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous bite sized portions of chicken, pasta, and vegetables, the ""Soup That Eats Like a Meal,"" is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.59 per can at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?

He found that instead of trying to chew these hard treats out of the rubber ball, he can get them out rather easily by dropping the ball to the kitchen floor, over and over again, until they come out. Once the treats are loose (5-10 minutes later) they break easily in his powerful jaws. Note: The treats don't come out so easily when he drops the ball on the carpet, but he knows that.  The treats keep him entertained for half an hour, maybe longer using one treat on each side of the ball. Not perfect, but I haven't found anything better.

565865,B0002X8HB4,A1NHFBR0X9892B,C. Rice,2,2,4,1337644800,My Experience  With This Treat,"After reading some of these reviews, I thought I'd comment on how I use this. I have a smallish (about 22 lbs) mixed breed dog who is a strong chewer. I started using a medium sized treat ball and everlasting treats when he was about 10 months old, right after I rescued him. I use this only with the treat ball -- I would never give him a whole treat and let him eat it in one session.  I put some kibble or some small treats in the ball, with the everlasting treat only on one side.  The kibble comes out fairly easily, but slowly enough so he still has to work for it and so he still has fun. The treats are a little larger and don't come out so easily. He's learned that chewing on the treat, pressing down on the ball, enable the treats to dispense. Once the kibble or treats are gone, he chews and licks the everlasting treat. Eventually, after several weeks, he manages to consume enough so there is a hold in the center of the treat, and at that point I usually take the everlasting treat out, break it in half, and let him have it, one half at a time.    It used to be that he would chew and lick the treat until he got bored, but he has now learned how to get the treat out. I've never actually seen him do this, so I don't know exactly how he does it, but I now take it away from him after I've decided he's had enough.    A couple of notes:  I think the smaller treat ball was recommended for a dog his size, but I got the medium because he's such a strong chewer.  I'm glad I did, as the smaller ball wouldn't have lasted long.  I do think this is an excellent toy/treat when used the way I use it. The treat isn't particularly nutritious, but if it's consumed over a period of weeks, it shouldn't be too harmful. Also, when it's filled with kibble, the dog is working for his food and, if you're having problems with your dog eating too fast, this will slow him or her down."

I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd; seven year old retired bomb detection German Shepherd, 11 month old Lab/terrier mix, and 8 month old Smooth Collie. The treats were out of the balls within minutes and demolished in under 30 minutes. I had put several smaller treats into the ball as well, so after they finished the larger treats, they managed to be entertained by trying to get the small treats out. There hasn't been much that the pack hasn't been able to figure out.    We regularly give them fresh deer bones as treats. The wolf will strip the meat while the shepherd will eat the bones, so I didn't expect these treats to be a true challenge for their jaw pressure and mental abilities. I will continue to get them and try other various tricks out. Some include putting the disc in upside down and adding peanut butter or other purees into the balls. The treats may not last long, but the balls will allow for some creative training."

Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.    Third: These are probably the least repugnant smelling of the discs, to me, anyway. It just smells like chicken broth when the dog gets going on it. I expected the Vanilla Mint ones to be better, but have found these are the least offensive."

However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings. Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights. Occasionally, the treat will ""pop out"" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.    I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).

I purchased it for my 7 month old pit bull, who is always into something and very highly food motivated.  Prior to the everlasting treat ball her favorite toy was the Chuckle, made by Premier.  The advantage to the chuckle is that I could fill it with her food for a nutritious but fun toy.  After a few months though, she learned how to get all the food out in under 10 minutes and I needed to find something else to occupy her while I focused on other things.    She was just a couple of pounds over 40 pounds when I purchased the treat ball.  Although the large looked too big for her, it was recommended for her size so I went with that one.  Now that I've seen her playing with it I can tell that the medium would have been too small.    The first time she got her paws on it, she chewed on the treat for six hours straight!  I actually had to take it away from her a few times and make her drink some water because I was afraid she'd make herself sick.  The discs weren't completely gone at the end of her play-fest, they really are ""everlasting.""  I usually give her the treat ball with both sides covered in their treats.  Her favorite is the barbecue, but it is also the darkest and will show up on fabric.  We've tried the chicken & liver too and had positive receptions to both.    Even after playing with this for a month I can still get a good hour to myself without having to worry about her getting in to trouble when I let her play with it.  I've also tried squeezing some cheese into the center hole for her to lick and she loves this as well!  I think peanut butter would be another excellent choice.  After about a month she has found a way to pop the treats out once in a while, but it seems to be by accident because she doesn't do it every time.  Even after she pops the treats out they still last a long time.  If she doesn't get them out herself, I pop them out when there is only a rim left and give them to her to chew on.    The only reason I gave this toy four stars instead of five is that I wish the holes in the center were smaller to accommodate her dog food or treats.  Small/med. treats fall out too quickly.  It does seem to be sized well for their Every Flavor treats, but we haven't really tried those so I can't comment on them.

Pros: 1) Most importantly: If our siberian will accept (as in devour!) these treats, we predict most any other fussy pups will too.    2) Someone intelligently designed the treat holders and shape of the treats themselves so that they can't be immediately removed and consumed... our dogs spend hours working on their treat ball. True to their breeds, our pups get in an occasional gnawing moment, but for the most part they have to lick and nibble their way through their treat. Which means when we leave for an extended time, they are honorably occupied, not bored, and not getting into mischief.    3) The ball itself is made of a soft-ish, somewhat pliable material, and yet appears to be indestructible. Time will tell.    4) A variety of flavors. We purchased each of the available flavors to learn which would ""win"", and immediately discovered that all flavors send our pups into exited expectation when they see their ball coming.    5) You can put your own treats inside the ball itself, but it looks like a tough nut for any dog to get to.    Con: and this could be a good thing: it's hard getting a treat into the ball unless you have strong hands/wrists, or a smooth ended spoon handle to help peel the retaining edge of the treat ball opening over the edge of the treat.

Petsmart and other pet stores sell a blue ball. You stick a treat on both sides of that one. I purchased one and promptly had to return it...because on the car ride home my dog was able to get chunks of the blue plastic ripped off. I at that time decided to never purchase one of these again. However, I was recently at Pet Supplies Plus getting my sheltie groomed and I wanted to get a treat for my heavy chewer since she got left at home and was very unhappy. While browsing the treat insert toys(kong, etc) I noticed the orange ball of this that holds one cookie and small kibble or treats on the other side. I promptly dismissed it because of it being an everlasting toy. I continued to browse and when I realized that we either have or have tried pretty much every other treat stuffed toy. I decided to try it since if she ripped it apart they would refund my money and I would know if it was good or not.    I got home and man oh man did I have a happy dog. She still has not even punctured the rough rubber. Unlike other reviewers stating that the treat came out easily in the blue ball this one did not. Once she had cleaned the middle out I could not get the treat out to save my life. I had to use a meat mallet to bust it apart. She does, however, get any kibble or other treats out of the backside very easily. We only put treats in the back when we need to get her interested again.    Just to elaborate on the chewing power of my dog. She can eat a full rawhide in just an hour or so. (a large rawhide with the tied ends, she is 26 pounds). She has also demolished a couple of kong's and ate through the rope on the tug-a-jug toy. She also completely chewed trough the Twist-and-treat by the same company.    The only other flaw I see with this product is the rubber. It is a lint/hair magnet. I hate picking it up and am constantly washing it because it picks up all the dog hair and lint possible...On the reverse side I love that it is not a toy that peanut butter or other semi solids work best in. I hate putting them in the kong because it leaves a very bad smell and clean up if not taken away promptly and cleaned.    Onto the cookies. They are very hard and last her a couple hours of constant chewing. I have a large treat ball even though she is weighted into the medium. I find the oversized toys help prevent her getting a good grip and ripping it apart. She seems to love the flavor and loves when we put a new treat in. I do find them at a very good price compared to other refill treats.    Over all I find it one of the best treat filled toy buys that we have made. It has out lasted any of the Kong's...even the black ones. It is easier to clean and provides her with a lot of enjoyment...and us with a lot of laughter as she tries to go at it."

Gluten is no big deal unless u have allergies or celiacs (do dogs get that?). They do make one with rice gluten if ur dog can't do wheat.  Garlic (like onion) causes a type of anemia in dogs if given in significant amounts, low levels like in this treat or in some foods is safe but I don't like it.    Also they don't last long if put in the way the toys show you. My dog gets it out and finishes it in less than a minute when put in right side up.  Upside down ( bump facing inside the ball) it takes her up to a week to finish it. I also give it to her for only like an hour or two at a time now because after a while when she had it out all the time she got bored with it. Taking it away keeps her interested. The Bento ball also works best for me.    Chicken is likely my dogs favorite flavor. I'm surprised she likes them because she's not very food oriented. (She also likes the natural ones but hates liver.)     Medium is the right size for my dog she's about aussie or border collie size 35 to 40 pound.

Most women who see this chew in person will experience a momentary impression that it resembles, yes, I'll say it, a diaphragm.  On a serious and positive note, the round chew is challenging for dogs to grasp when the chew is concave to the floor.  Hardwood makes an excellent shuffleboard surface and my dogs kick and chase it for fun.  The exterior is somehow resistant to dog saliva, so messy floor streaks and drool spots were surprisingly absent.  My two dogs kick it, chase it and trot about the house with these very durable chews for days.  Eventually, something possesses the dogs and they start working at dismantling the 'bone'.  It literally takes hours of dedicated canine chomping and gnawing for the chew to be reduced to crumbs.  The final word is that there are no intestinal after effects in what I have observed in my two English Springers. These ""Everlasting Treats"" make it possible for me to sit down and watch a film in solitude. - an activity long ago lost by any 'Springer parent'."

Moist, yes, with a marvelous mouthfeel, cut into succulent strips and hunks.  Another winner is the Honey Pepper flavor, which masterfully mates sweetness and heat in a winning combination.  Teriyaki is O.K., but it's never been a favorite of mine, so my opinion is biased in that arena.  I was buying World Kitchens jerky (at ten or so dollars a pound it's probably the best jerky bargain out there), but Buffalo Bill's is, in my opinion, far superior.  Just about double the price of World Kitchens (an eight ounce bag is about twelve dollars), but well worth it.

This jerky is mediocre at best. The meat is very moist and has a lot of flavor but is overly sweet and salty, almost as if they drenched this in syrup and soy sauce before cooking it. The name Spicy Country should be changed to Mild Country. The slices are too thick and look like boba straws. I also wouldn't recommend it if you prefer your jerky a little more chewier.    Positive side: $15 for jerky might be steep but 8 oz is a lot and it's definitely worth the price.    It's good jerky, but not the best.    If you're looking for some good jerky. Try Jack Links Peppered. It's one of the best jerky's I've had and it's available at your local grocery store.    If you're ever in Gilroy, CA, visit the Garlic Shoppe. BEST beef jerky I ever had.

565971,B0032BOIH0,AMAISIRBII1IQ,"R. Seagrave ""YorkieDog""",12,12,5,1293840000,Great for my picky eaters!,"I have had all of my dogs on this formula for almost a year.    I own a retail store and do a lot of research into what dog foods are best for your pet. I always take ingredients into account when considering a dog food for my dogs. When it comes right down to it, it doesn't matter how great the food if your pet will not eat it. I have also come to realize that every dog is different and what might be considered undesirable for one dog might actually be best for another.    It took me a very long while to try the Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28 because of the corn gluten. My dogs were very picky eaters and basically grazers, eating only here and there. Once my dogs tried Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28, you would have thought I had fed them candy as they would consume all that I placed before them.    I have 5 Yorkies and 2 poodles - this formula is not just for Yorkies. (I do not breed - they are simply my best little friends.)    With the Yorkies, I no longer had to worry about whether they were getting enough to eat. As they stayed on this formula, I began to notice silkier coats and over all well-being not only in appearance but in energy. One of my Yorkies had a very thin coat, since being on this formula her coat has come in thicker and absolutely shines regardless of whether or not she needs a bath or a brushing.    The 2 poodles are rescues. The oldest being around 20 years old. She will not eat anything but Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28. She is all bones with zero muscle tone due to ill treatment before she came to me, but I don't have to worry about trying to get her to eat on this formula. Before feeding this food it was hit or miss as to whether or not she would eat. She weighs 3.5 pounds so I worry about her a great deal.    The other poodle is young. He came to me with a multitude of ailments, mostly stomach or parasite related. All the dog foods that had meat as the first and 2nd ingredients that also excluded corn, wheat and soy would go right through him. When I tried this formula on him, it was to me a miracle. His mobility problems ceased, no more stool problems - he absorbed the food better as stool size was greatly decreased. He also gained the much need 2 pounds.    Overall, my dogs love the taste. They find the shape easier to chew as well. They will turn their heads if I offer them other choices.    I wish it was corn free, but it works for them and that is what counts.    The largest bag size is limited to 10 lbs.    As I said all dogs are different and not all Yorkies are gonna love this formula. I raved about this food to my best friend and had her order from Amazon. She wanted to give her 3 dogs something new as they seemed bored with their food, but when it arrived they would have nothing to do with it. They wanted their Evanger's Pheasant & Brown Rice back immediately! (Which was a favorite of my dogs too, until Royal Canin.) So I would advise that you try a small bag first, even though not as cost effective, to see if your little ones like before getting the 10 lb bag.    Full Ingredient List:  Chicken meal, brown rice, rice, chicken fat, corn gluten meal, barley, wheat gluten meal, natural chicken flavor, powdered cellulose, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), dried brewers yeast, potassium chloride, soya oil, fructo-oligosaccharides, sodium tripolyphosphate, salt, calcium carbonate, taurine, dried brewers yeast extract (source of mannan-oligosaccharides), dried egg product, choline chloride, DL-methionine, Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), inositol, niacin supplement, L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), D-calcium pantothenate, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin supplement (vitamin B2), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), vitamin A acetate, folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], magnesium oxide, Trace Minerals [zinc proteinate, zinc oxide, ferrous sulfate, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, calcium iodate, sodium selenite], glucosamine hydrochloride, marigold extract (Tagetes erecta L.), tea (green tea extract), L-carnitine, chondroitin sulfate, rosemary extract, preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of vitamin E) and citric acid.  _______________________________________    In my opinion, food ingredients to always avoid are : Animal Digest & UNKNOWN fats and oils which are NOT in this formula : )    This formula works for my dogs. There are plenty of foods out there with better ingredients, but this is what is helping my dogs and keeps them VERY happy.    I hope this review gives you something to think about when deciding whether or not to try this food."

Her coat has turned glossy again as when she was younger. The dry skin is gone as well, although that really was due to her laying in front of the oil heater or the fireplace stove.

Gives you about 8 grams of protein (hardly 25% daily minimum requirement) but corn does not provide all the essential amino acids for building protein do you would have to have something else with it, such as beans, meat, chicken, etc. in order to make use of that."

I decided to take another chance on ordering meal bars from Amazon. This time, I ordered Kashi meal bars, which have slightly more carbohydrate than the AdvantEdge bars but don't contain sugar alcohols, which give me gas.    The Kashi bars are great: all 11 of them. The box contained 12 bars, but it was severely crushed during shipment, which destroyed the 12th bar. I know that the damage occurred during shipment because the outside box in which Amazon shipped the meal-bar box was crushed like an accordion, worse than the boxes of AdvantEdge bars ever were.    So, my review of the Kashi bars is pretty the same as for the AdvantEdge bars. Kashi bars are a good product, but they're sometimes melted or crushed during shipment.    With 11 usable Kashi bars in the box I just received, Amazon's lower price still makes them slightly cheaper than they are at the supermarket. But it's chancy.

I bought the frosting starter with the white chocolate raspberry add-in, and it nearly ruined my cake. The frosting consistency is way off - it's drippy and doesn't hold well to the cake. Looks awful. But worse, the taste was unpalatable. It tasted like cough medicine and sugar substitute. I couldn't bring myself to put it on my daughter's birthday cake, so I fiddled with it for about 20 minutes until it was edible and a little thicker. The cake ended up being eaten well by the kids, but the adults mostly scraped the icing off. Even after all my fiddling with it, it was only slightly better. Duncan Hines regular icing is great, in all varieties. But stay far away from Frosting Creations. I wish I'd dumped it in the trash and started from scratch. I now have a half eaten cake that no one wants because the frosting tastes off."

Pros:  It did mix well, there was enough space left on top to stir and the powder did dissolve nicely.    It was very easy to spread and swirl.    Cons:  The texture was almost stringy/rubbery.  The taste was horrific without anything. It tasted like a gooey marshmallow having a bad day.    We added the flavoring and it did not help.  The strange texture, flavor and now with the added caramel, it was simply disgusting.    While the idea in theory was intriguing, the product failed completely in its execution."

They were both disgusting and inedible. they smelled and tastes completely chemical, and the flavor barely comes through.

Eating them side by side is like drinking half and half, and then expecting 2% to taste the same. If this type of comparison is hard for you to notice, then you'll love PB2!    But remember, it's NOT peanut butter. Don't go expecting it to have the mouth-feel of full fat, smooth ground peanuts.

I don't think I could ever go back to regular PB again. This packaging is a little awkward, once I cut it open, I put it in a plastic container to stay fresh. There is no resealing the package."

When I first tried it, I must admit I was a little turned off.  I couldn't decide whether I liked it or hated it.  But over time, I have grown to love this stuff.  I am on a high protein/low carb diet and normally peanut butter would be out of the question due to its high fat and calorie content.  That's what makes this stuff so great.  Sure its not as good as peanut butter but when is a low calorie version ever better than the original?  It's a great snack and takes away my cravings instantly.  I can eat it anytime of the day without feeling guilty.  I try to keep it between 1 and 2 servings which is just 45-90 calories.  The additional protein it gives me is a bonus.  I just ordered 3 more."

I dip a banana into the mixed up PB2 and have an awesome snack!      Another way that I like to eat it is mixed up in some plain Greek yogurt. I mix a spoonful of PB2 and a spoonful of sugar-free jelly into a 5.3 oz Oikos Greek yogurt container. It is delicious just like this or spread on some toasted thin buns. Mmmmm....mmmmmm!      The only downside is that I don't like it by itself. It has to be on a banana or an apple or be mixed with something."

Product arrived in an airtight bag which looked a bit small for the money. When mixed with water to reconstitute the amount of peanut butter seemed okay. Product tasted very fresh. This is an excellent product if you like peanut butter but worry about fats and oils. Most are removed. I recommend the product. It has multiple uses. Can mix with honey, use as a topping and of course make peanut butter cookies. That last one is my favorite. PB cookies are my weakness."

However, I am very health conscious, and I realize I can't eat peanut butter all day and stay thin. However, you really could eat PB2 all day and still successfully watch your weight.  This stuff is remarkably good, and I've tried just about everything out there in terms of lower calorie peanut butter substitutes.  I absolutely crave this stuff - So, if you love your PB&J but don't want to trade in for a larger pair of pants, then PB2 is the way to go.  It really does taste great.  When it comes in these 16 oz. bags like this, they're a bit messy. Powder seems to get everywhere.  I usually pour them into a large zip-lock bag (but a canister would be even better) to scoop out what I want, when I want it. Just a little tip there."

I actually haven't tried mixing it with water as per the directions, but I don't think I would enjoy it on its own or on toast, just as it isn't sweet enough (sorry, I need that bit of added sugar!). HOWEVER, I'm big on adding peanut butter to cottage cheese, and 2 tbsp of this PB2 powder to 1/2 cup cottage cheese is lovely!

I think that while it is not quite the same as normal name brand peanut butter, but when you compare it to Skippy or Planter's brands - the two I had in my house to compare it to - this peanut butter has 75% fewer calories.  There is no way that I would rate this as being 75% less satisfying, so if your goal is to find a substitute for peanut butter that is better in terms of overall calories, this is the way to go.  It might take some experimenting to get it to a consistency you like.  The recommended 2 tbsp powder to 2 tbsp water was a bit thick for me.  Finally, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses peanut butter as an ingredient, as opposed to just eating something with peanut butter on it.  The powder dissolves much more easily than you can get actual peanut butter to mix into a sauce.  I particularly have enjoyed it in milk shakes."

When I blended with fresh strawberries, ice, a touch of fat free milk and stevia I found that this made the most delish lowfat/sugar PBJ smoothie ever!

566164,B004P4POZ8,ANMA1H8LGEVBF,"KeithNYC ""KeithInNYC""",90,94,5,1319587200,"UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter","Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O"">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).    Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.    ***UPDATE***  Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this."

I checked Amazon and found the 1 lb bag at a much better price than the grocery store jar.  We use it when we travel and at home.  You honestly cannot tell the difference in it and a jar of processed peanut butter. You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.

Looking for peanut flavoring or extract, I was shocked to find PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, a product I'd never imagined.  Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.    It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.  Low calorie, low fat, scrumptious and versatile -- what a concept."

For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack."

I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.  The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?  The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.    Pros  +lower calorie  +great price here on amazon  +does taste similar to peanut butter    Cons  -less nutritional value  -doesn't taste like real peanut butter    I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else."

The taste and texture is just like peanut butter--I could kiss whoever came up with this, LOL.    I don't like to waste food, so I have been mixing it with my Walden Farms' spread, which makes it that much less calorie, and it actually tastes good mixed together. Although I like the mixture of the two, PB2 is good enough and low cal enough on its own that I would recommend it to any peanut butter lover that wants to watch their caloric intake (like me!).

That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.    I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better). It actually tastes really good! I tried them separately and they were both good, but I prefer them mixed. My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).    Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard. I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want.    I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed. PB2 is well worth the money and I will be buying it regularly."

I love mixing up a small bowl to go, and eating it with sliced apples as a snack.  It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...

But it's VERY CLOSE! If you can handle all the fat and calories from the real stuff, go ahead and stick with it. However, if you LOVE peanut butter, but find you are needing to cut back, PB2 is the way to go!  It's a little pricey. I think there are places to get it cheaper, but I went with Amazon since I was ordering other items and getting free shipping.  Mixing it with water and reconstituting it works fine, although a little grainy. And many have already commented that it doesn't amount to much, making it hard to SLATHER on stuff. Since I'm not making peanut butter sandwiches with this stuff, it's not a big deal to me.  It's not as sweet as many PB's, it's definitely more like a natural peanut butter in flavor. Personally, I love it for mixing it into my greek yogurt. YUM! A little extra protein and it tastes like a creamy peanut butter mousse. I love it!  I haven't tried mixing it in oatmeal yet, but that's next!

I also am adverse to products whose ingredients I don't recognize.  But this one really, really delivers.  It has the same taste as regular peanut butter with a slightly fluffier texture. Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.  That's it.    Pros:  GREAT taste  Very low-calorie  16-oz package is a waaaaay better deal than elsewhere  Much more versatile than regular creamy PB    Cons:  Needs to be mixed with water, which means another bowl to wash  Can't eat it out of a jar with a spoon (which, if you're dieting, might also be a pro!) :]    Ways I use it:  Sandwiches (of course)  In cookies, cakes, brownies, and other places where the consistency of PB is tricky  With my whey protein shakes in the morning (chocolate whey powder or cocoa powder, PB2, almond or regular milk, ice, makes a reeses cup milkshake!)

UPDATE:  PB2 is my first choice all the time now.  Not having the oil is worth the little sweetness that is present in the PB2, and the salt tastes about the same as the salt in the Smuckers Natural.

566202,B004P4POZ8,A2ZJRC1DW3THKC,Mike,1,2,4,1332460800,Great on a cut...value not so much,"To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor."

Excellent mixed with honey, preserves, etc., but it takes more of those things that are not water to make the PB, and is there really a point of mixing PB2 with something other than water if you are looking for the health benefit?    As a huge fan of crunchy PB, and having eaten only natural PB for years, I already receive the benefit of not eating hydrogenated oil (we all have to have some fat), so I'm not gaining the same benefits from the PB2 that I would if I were moving from Jiff or Skippy to this almost no-fat product."

I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.    It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.

I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter.

My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2!

Sayer,4,5,4,1331683200,"Not quite peanut butter, but a reasonable substitute","I've been on a diet and exercise program and was eating peanut butter as a snack and it started to get out of hand and I couldn't lose any weight. Well with roughly 200 calories in 2T of peanut butter, it is easy to figure out why. My trainer told me about PB2 so I got some to try and I do like it. It is NOT peanut butter, it lacks the creamy smooth taste. I guess if I had to explain what it tastes like, I would say peanut butter cookie dough - basically imagine what peanut butter would taste like mixed with flour. But given that I can eat it for 1/4 of the calories, it is a reasonable substitute when I crave peanut butter.    As I recall, the instructions call for 2T of powder and 1T of water. I found that wasn't enough water to mix it up properly and had to put in a little extra. Over time I've found 1T of water is needed for every 1T of powder (equal parts), and that provides a creamier texture.    If I've got a few extra calories to burn for the day, I will sometimes mix 3T of PB2, 3T of water, and 1T of real peanut butter.    So PB2 is a great product and it is helping me meet my diet goals, but I wish it tasted more like real peanut butter. I haven't tried it in smoothies or anything like that (because I don't drink them), but I can see how that could be good if you enjoy them. I've ordered some of the chocolate flavored and I look forward to trying it."

No. Is the consistency the same as a full fat peanut butter? No.  Does it taste good and act as a good substitute? Yes!  I've made PBJs with this and it is not quite the same (but good), PB and honey--I don't advise it, Thai peanut sauce--excellent..  The best use of this product is in smoothies with bananas, blueberries, protein powder, and coco.

With PB2 I don't need to worry about using the product quickly before it turns rancid.  I can measure my portions much more easily.  PB2 is so much easier to take with me for lunch or snacks.  PB2 is only 45 calories compared it the oily stuff's 220 calories.  PB2 is great for adding into smoothies, yogurt, curries, soups, and just about anything you can think of whilst in the kitchen.

PB2 isn't a perfect replacement for peanut butter, but it has a natural taste to it, is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile.  I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product.    When turning PB2 into peanut butter, don't add too much water, or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted.  In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread, I also put PB2 powder in smoothies, on cereal and with oatmeal."

Amazing!","I have difficulty controlling portion size when I eat peanut butter, which wrecks my diet, and is preventing me from losing the last 20 lbs. I need to lose. After trying the revolting Walden Farms 0 Calorie Peanut Spread, several Amazon users recommended this product. PB 2 is real peanut butter in powdered form. It's had most of the fat extracted from the peanuts. It contains just three ingredients: peanuts, salt, and sugar. It's more natural than many regular PB brands. Each 2 tbsp. serving contains 45 calories and just 1.5 g of fat (compared to 190 or 200 calories and 16 g of fat in regular PB). You mix one to two tbsp of water per two tbsp of PB2. This is one of the few diet foods that tastes the same as the regular stuff, instead of being an inferior chemical tasting imitation of the original. I mix it with sugar free syrup and spread it on an apple for a 115 calorie dessert that tastes awesome!"

The owner raved about it and offered me a sample. I was sold at first bite! I loved the clean taste without all the sugar and additives. I bought a jar and as I continued to eat it on our Daniel Fast, I just had to go on line to order more. I offered some to my 14 yr. old granddaughter and  she is sold on it too. She also thinks it tastes better than regular peanut butter.  I can have 3 TBS, get the same amount of protein with less than 68 calories. I have mixed it in oatmeal & I have added part water and part total fruit spread for a sandwich. You get all the fun with none of the guilt and it has so much nutrition! Eating this is saying goodbye to empty calories and being able to carry it with me is a great benefit. If you really care about living a healthier lifestyle, you will want to order this awesome peanut butter.  It also comes in chocolate with the same food value. I even posted it on my facebook page.

All of the flavor and taste of peanut butter, without all the peanut oil."

I use it as an ingredient in my homemade protein bars but also have tried it every way I can think of.  As a peanut butter junkie, I was not sure I would like this, but its great.  Mixed per the instructions with water and I think it tastes as good or better than most commercial brands and without the fat.  Okay, but I am lazy, too. I empty the original package into a glass container with a snap on lid.  I find it easier to get the product out without spilling this way.  It also makes it easy to dip bananas for each bite.  Sprinkles on vanilla or chocolate ice cream? You betcha!  Here is one that sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  Mix two tbsps. powder with one tbsp. water and five or six drops of your favorite hot sauce.  Spread this over a freshly grilled hamburger and enjoy.  It sort of tastes like Thai beef satay, only better and juicier.  It is a little pricey at this size and I am hoping to find larger, bulk sizes."

However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know ""it's a good fat"").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!

Must add a pack of splenda to it to make it sweet enough for me, otherwise it's fine.

Now it's not without ANY calories...2 TBlspoons does have 45 calories and  some carbs (not more than peanutbutter) _----- but that's a lot less calories  than the real thing ...    ...this is not an artificial product either.  It's real peanutbutter with the fat taken out.  Other companies have tried to make this, but none have sold it in the powder form until this.      Put some dry powder in your cream of wheat....yum!    So this works.  I bought the packets so I could try it out.  Love it.  Buying more.  Just know, that it's going to be a little different, but in the end, you'll learn how the product works and you'll find your own wonderful uses!

But --- I really like peanut butter, and how could they make it taste good and take all that oil and all those calories out? A ton of reviewers claimed it was good - but I just had to see for myself. I ordered both the regular and chocolate.  I couldn't wait to get the shipment. It came today (sooner than expected) - and I immediately mixed up the regular PB2. At first it looked like grainy stuff and water. I kept stirring - and pretty soon my spoon was coated with peanut butter - and I had a nice little mound of peanut butter in the bowl! Well - at least it looks like peanut butter - that's something! Then I tasted a little with my finger. Wait .... WHAT?? Seriously - it really IS peanut butter!! It looks like it, smells like it and tastes like it! I grew up in the mid-west, enjoying peanut butter and sweet pickle sandwiches. (Yes - sounds weird, I know - but have you tried it? Wonderful!) I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier - and those can't be enjoyed very often. I've been using the high fiber whole grain tortillas that are only 50 calories - so I spread some PB2 down the center - and placed a few pickle slices on top. I rolled up and tasted ----- perfect! I know I'm going to love this stuff! Another thing I like to do - is just scoop a spoonful of peanut butter and eat it (we call it a ""peanut butter pop""). Well guess what - this is good enough that you can even do that! If you are used to Jiff like I am - just sprinkle a bit of Splenda in the PB2 as you mix it up for that little bit of extra sweetness! I read a few reviews by people who said PB2 wasn't anything like real peanut butter - and I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about!! I was fully prepared to sacrifice flavor for the goal of lowering fat and calories - but I'm so excited to find out I don't have to! Oh - and the PB2 Chocolate is pretty darned good stuff too! Buy PB2 and try it for yourself - you'll find a million ways to use it, I'm sure! All I wonder - is where has this been, and why didn't I know about it? I'll be telling every nutrition conscious person I know! Happy, healthy eating!!"

That should suffice for the ""how'd you like it?"" part. It's a pretty good sub for actual pb on sandwiches, etc., (found it mixed better with a bit of hot water rather than cold) but it's at least as good if not better in smoothies. First day, I tried it with the banana as folks had suggested, but discovered I liked it even better with just cold almond milk. Since then, I've been adding a packet or two of stevia and a tablespoon of ground flax to the mixture and having it in a tall glass with ice cubes; tastes like a pb milkshake! Yum. Only slight negative is the sugar they add to the powder; would prefer if this company sold a plain pb version (with or without the salt). Other than that, it's just about perfect."

I put it on watermelon and I used to put it in my cup of vanilla ice cream.  This was in 1970 before peanut butter and ice cream was an actual flavor at ice cream parlors.  I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?    As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.    PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.    When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.    PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.    I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.  With PB2, you can have your cake and eat it too!"

I also like to add a serving of it to my coffee drinks, but just know that if you mix it in with a spoon, it will eventually settle at the bottom of water based drinks. The nutritional benefit is 5g of protein per serving and a mere 40 calories (versus 180 calories for a serving of peanut butter). Unfortunately when you cut out the calories, you also cut out the heart healthy fats so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete substitute for real peanut butter if you're eating peanut butter for healthy heart reasons.

I'd read that this PB2 is not the same as regular peanut butter, but many reviewers say it's a good substitute.  Therefore I expected it to be different, but not distasteful. I'm used to eating healthy fare and realize there has to be a trade off.  However, I was quite disappointed in this product. It feels chalky and tastes like stale fake peanuts. For someone on a restricted diet who is desperate to eat some type of peanut butter, this may work. I'll stick to the regular stuff and continue on my way."

I see that some of the other posters say that they could eat a bag a day -- Ha!  I could eat a bag of these tasty little morsels at every meal, wipe my face with the bag and hope I could sneak a few more for dessert.    One negative reviewer said that these chips are dry.  Of course they're dry!  It's called crispy, and Stacy's chips have crispness in abundance.  You open the bag and the delicate scent of cinnamon and of baked goods, exactly as if you had just opened the door to your favorite bakery. Breathe deep -- this is your bag of chips, and why not enjoy it?  Look in the bag and see those golden brown triangles of crisp-baked pita, generously covered with good cinnamon and sugar.  Offer a chip to the other people in the room, after all you have to be polite.  Be secretly glad that no one here knows how good they are, so you won't have to share - this time.    Now you can take one of those perfect triangles and either bite it daintily or just pop it in your mouth. (Here's where it gets a little hazy)  You're going to have a few minutes of incredible flavor and texture, just like Mama used to make, if she made ""crust cookies,"" pie crust generously sprinkled with Cinnamon and Sugar, and baked to a flaky crispness. Take another bite and enjoy.  Let all those memories drift over you...    And then you have an empty bag!  how could that be?  I had a full bag not two minutes before.  It must be some kind of universal time warp that occurs whenever I have a bag of Stacy's Chips.  I open the bag, lift a chip to my mouth and suddenly, the bag is empty, I want more, although I fear that eating three or more bags of these snacks a day would leave me the size of the Hindenburg.  Ah well, tomorrow is another day.  Hmmm - I may have gotten by that ""one-a-day"" rule.  Eat your normal bag of chips in the afternoon, then wait until after dinner.  Grab a bag of chips when you sit down with the family after dinner.  If anyone notices or says anything, say ""I wanted to have a bag with lunch, but I (forgot to grab them, the Quickie-mart was out, whatever excuse suits your fancy)    Devour your second bag, and say that you want to watch a little bit of late night television after everyone else has retired for the night.  See all the misery and tragedy that news people love to send over the airwaves to keep you from having sweet dreams.  Now you have to do something to take your mind off the problems of the world. How about a little (tiny, really) bag of wonderfulness?  yep, it's after midnight, a new day, and time for your first bag of Stacy's to lull you off to sleep.  Best of all, no one knows about it!    All of this is dependent upon Amazon and their wonderful delivery program which delivers these amazing treats at a very reasonable price.  Here in my area, the price that Amazon asks is less than half the cost at the Supermarket!  I can eat twice as many for the same price!  Whoo-Hoo!    All kidding aside, these are wholesome, tasty snacks that aren't fried and can add a real punch of flavor to a low calorie diet.  They are delicious, economical and have none of the grease that you feel and taste in fried chips. Amazon sells them for a terrific price, and they arrive at your home amazingly fresh and without one broken chip.  (Your chip breakage may vary)    If this hasn't given you a reason to try these tasty little morsel of paradise, then I can't help you."

I am going to try my luck and this time either try it with apricot/peach preserves/jam....maybe with a little cream cheese.....hmmmm. Anyway, the almond butter tasted great with this, imo. It is also very tasty as is.

In the process of having three surgeries, chemo and radiation treatments I, of course, lost my taste buds and couldn't find anything that really tasted good to me.  Having lost thirty pounds that I couldn't afford to lose, I desperately searched for something that tasted good to me.  Then I discovered Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Baked Pita Chips!  How delicious they are!!!!    I have gained ten pounds and could eat three bags of these chips per day except I can't afford them.  No only are they hard to find at stores in the Charlotte, NC area, they are really expensive.  Harris Teeter grocery stores stock them but they charge $3.49 per bag and Bi-Lo grocery stores charge $3.99 per bag.  With so few chips in a large bag, that is really too high.    My last order for Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar chips through Amazon was for 24 of the small bags which really doesn't last me long.  By the time I add in shipping and handling for my order, I really don't save any money.  Being retired with a fixed income and incurring so many recent medical bills, I find it hard to afford to buy the chips.    My recommendation to Stacy's Pita Chips Company would be to add more chips to the bag and also lower the retail price.  It would be great to have the chips available in discound stores, such as Wal-Mart, etc., in order to purchase them at a cheaper price.    Stacy's should give me a free year's supply of the Cinnamon Sugar chips because I have told other cancer patients, a lot of friends and family about the chips and seem to have everybody ""hooked"" on them."

Friedman ""Schoolmarm""",0,0,3,1311811200,Could be Better,"It's delightful to see so many mainstream companies trying to improve the nutritional value of their products.  With this Veggie Pasta Macaroni and Cheese, Kraft has made a nice attempt in that direction with a product that has a very high kid-favored status.    The veggies in question are in the pasta itself, which is made of a combination of grain and cauliflower.  It is tasty, indistinguishable from the standard wheat pasta product, and cooks up nicely al dente.  I truly enjoyed it and hope to find more of this pasta (alone) on the shelves.  It is far less tough than the more common tomato and spinach pastas.    But that's where the goodness pauses while the powdered cheese sauce mix--still the original formula as far as I could tell--jumps in and loads the meal with sodium.  According to the package, it delivers a whopping 550 mg (23% of the adult daily requirement for someone on a 2000 calorie diet).  That jumps higher (28%) if the product is prepared with the added butter or margarine (I used an olive oil-based spread for just a bit of additional nutrition) and 2% reduced-fat milk (I used 1%, which did not affect the quality of the cheese sauce at all).  The calorie-count is still good at 370 for a full serving, which is half the box and about right for an adult if a salad or some other vegetable is served alongside.  I also added canned water-packed tuna to fill it out a bit so two adults would be satisfied.    I'm sure Kraft could lower the sodium content without making the meal less palatable to the children it's really aimed at feeding.  If they do that, then this will become an excellent addition to the pantry shelf.  There's no denying that the flavor is great and the texture is exactly right, with the cheese sauce remaining slightly liquid without turning pasty as it sits on the plate.  Overall, it's a good start, and it certainly would be an improvement in the diets of families used to the regular Mac-and-Cheese products."

So, what makes this Veggie Mac-n-cheese? Well, according the the ingredient list, the pasta contains dried cauliflower along with the normal wheat.  Apparently there is enough dried cauliflower to make 1/2 serving of veggies per 1 cup of pasta.    Is there any other difference nutrition wise?

Bottom Line:  Just buy the normal mac and cheese and get your fiber elsewhere.  Nutrition content per serving is nearly identical (as boxed), and as prepared they tell you to use half as much margarine in the vegi mac and cheese vs the normal, so don't compare the ""as prepared"" nutrition content as you can easily cut the butter down with the normal and still retain great taste.  The normal box is 3 servings with 4T butter, this box is 2 servings with 2T butter, so cut the normal down to 3T and you should be fairly similar.    Taste wise I notice very little difference between the two, this veggie mac might have a slight vegi aftertaste, but nothing too offensive.  If the price per serving were closer together I would recommend this mac and cheese.  The difference in taste is nothing as strong as whole wheat vs white flour breads.

You can compare to to regular Mac and Cheese - it's healthier!  Or you can compare it to stuff in the produce aisle - it's processed crap disguised as health food!  Both approaches are valid.    The cheddar cheese powder tastes great as always, and the new veggie noodles taste the same but smell slightly off.  The box helpfully informs you on the back that one serving of this stuff provides 1/10th of your recommended daily helping of veggies, but uses up 1/4th of your allowance of saturated fat and sodium and about 1/5th of your allowance of calories.  Actually, it doesn't tell you that in so many words, but that's what you'll find if you read between the lines.  Delicious yes, health food no.    In the end this is just a gimmick product to charge more for.  For some reason the price of Kraft 50% Whole Wheat Mac and Cheese remains about double the price of regular Mac and Cheese, and it looks like Veggie Pasta will hold to that strategy too.    My advice: stock up on regular old Kraft Mac and Cheese when it goes on sale, toss out the noodles and use the cheddar powder with store-brand 100% whole grain macaroni noodles.  Eat a couple carrots while the water boils, and you'll come out ahead on both price and nutrition."

Cooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage. I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients. We got two decent sized servings from the box. The resulting mixture was just o.k. For me, the pasta had no texture and little taste, only a mild cheese flavor. Mrs. Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a ""good addition."" She thought it was less creamy than ""Easy Mac"" or the regular variety. She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better, and I agree with her.

It's yummy, not as rich (or calorie/fat-laden) as homemade, and reminiscent of many people's dinner-or-lunch-at-home-when-parents-are-out and/or college days. The fact that this new option contains ""1/2 serving of vegetables per cup*"" is good... I guess. I do, however, find this addition of ""vegetables"" a bit unsettling. It's great that kids (and adults) are getting ""extra"" vegetables, but I've got a few questions:    * How exactly are these vegetables incorporated into the Mac & Cheese?  Are they powdered? Mushed and blended? Does the process that incorporates them into the M&C completely (or mostly) destroy the vegetables' nutritional value???    * Does the addition of these vegetables - and marketing/pushing of said addition - mean that parents are going to stop worrying so much about making their kids eat actual vegetables, since they figure they're getting ""something"" in their Mac & Cheese? (This scares me) Similarly, is this going to undermine the process of ""assisting"" kids in developing a taste for actual vegetables?    I fear the answer to these questions is not great, and for those reasons, if the price of the new ""veggies added"" M&C was the same as the regular version (or only a few cents higher), I'd probably buy it (both for my nephews and myself). As soon as I placed it in my cart, however, I'd pretend that it wasn't ""veggie-tabulous"" and still make sure that they (and I) had a FULL serving of a green vegetable on their (my) plate, alongside the yummy, bright-as-a-safety-cone Mac & Cheese."

They accomplish this sneaky feat by incorporating cauliflower into the macaroni.  While I do have opinions on the long-term benefits of disguising vegetables into kids' food as opposed to feeding them actual vegetables, I will put my concerns aside in an effort to objectively review this product.  (Besides, mac and cheese is a highly processed food anyway, which leads to a whole other debate).    Without comparing ingredient lists (which I prefer not to look at for this type of food), it appears that the characteristic cheese sauce pouch has been unaltered.  The orange, salty yet creamy taste that I loved as a child and as an adult is intact.  The only issue I had with the veggie version is the macaroni texture.  The traditional Kraft macaroni is forgiving as far as cooking times - I have overcooked and undercooked the macaroni over the years with acceptable results.  However, though I followed the cooking time guidelines and tasted the noodles frequently, the overall texture was somewhat mushy compared to the traditional recipe.    In order to get a whole serving of vegetables, one would have to eat the whole box of mac and cheese (which is something I have certainly done).  Clearly this product is not satisfy the ""Strive for 5 fruits and vegetables a day"" criteria for healthy eating, but I suppose that it is better than nothing.  Because lets face it - Kraft Mac and Cheese is good, and people old and young are going to eat it anyway, so why not have half a serving of cauliflower at the same time?"

You just boil the macaroni until it is soft and there is little water remaining, then add grated cheese, margarine or butter, and a little milk.  Stir it until the mixture has melted and is coating the pasta, and serve.  Black pepper tops it off nicely.  Using these packets is only slightly more convenient and a lot more expensive, plus you are getting heavily processed ingredients.  I'm not convinced that including some dried cauliflower in the pasta really makes it a healthy option.    Actually, cauliflower goes very well with Macaroni and Cheese.

An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.

Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.    If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.

ADd the cheese, milk (in my case unsweetend Soy Milk) butter (in my case olive oil), mixed everyhing as per instructions,and -- well..    I suppose this serves two or three people, but I ate the WHOLE pot in two closely spaced sittings. Ummm! It was creamy and WONDERFUL!! The cauliflower gave the pasta a tangy-sweet taste. On the second sitting (which took place about 5 minutes after the first sitting) I added Little Baby Peas to the mix, because I LOVE to add Little Baby Peas to my Mac and Cheese -- and then I scarfed it all up.

Two of my other reservations involve the sodium level, and the stuff's ultimate nutritional void.    So, enter Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original. Using cauliflower in both the pasta and the sauce, Kraft has managed to accomplish the very same thing I'd been doing (sneaking in veggies), so I do feel better about this version. The bright orange color is there, so my son was happy, too. I hadn't told him I was trying anything new, but judging by the way he wolfed down his meal this tastes the exact same. Of course, that still leaves my sodium concern, and with 28% of the daily allowance in a prepared single serving, there's still quite a bit of salt in here.    That said, my husband -- who does NOT like mac & cheese OR cauliflower -- also polished off his plate. In 14 years of marriage, I've never seen him do that. So whatever Kraft's up to, it's good and I'm glad not to have to make two separate dinners anymore!    To sum up:    PROS:    1. A good dose of cauliflower in both the pasta and sauce.  2.

The box is 5.5 ounces so slightly smaller than the regular kind, but the serving size is the same per ounce as the original (70 grams),although the box says there are only two servings in the this box.  I am not sure how many servings are in a regular box.  The stats are pretty much the same as regular except for this has 05.g less saturated fat and 2 grams  more in fiber.    In each 1 cup serving there is 1/4 cup worth of veggies (in the form of powdered cauliflower.)  One serving of veggies is 1/2 cup so this will definitely not replace all of your, or your child's, veggie requirements for the day.  You would have to eat the whole box yourself to get just ONE serving of vegetables!  There are lower calorie was to get a serving of veggies!!    Now, what you REALLY want to know is does it TASTE good?  Well, yes it does!  It actually tastes no different from the regular.  My son was none the wiser to his regular box being replaced with this Veggie version.  While you are cooking it, you can smell the cauliflower but it is not terribly bad.  Once you mix the cheese packet, butter and milk you can't smell it anymore.    So do I recommend it?  Yes.  1/2 serving of veggies is better than none, and since the taste seems virtually the same how can you go wrong."

There is only 1/2 serving of veggies per cup, but getting an extra half serving of veggies in your mac and cheese isn't such a bad deal, really (and if you mix in some peas or green beans, then you've got yourself a bit of a meal). (I think the real question here is if we should wonder if the federal regulations for saying something has a serving of vegetables/fruit have become too lax lately.)    I'd definitely buy it again. I'm currently pregnant, so any place I can sneak in an extra vegetable serving (especially since so many normal foods don't appeal to me now) is good.

I was hoping that this would be a good alternative for a diabetic friend, but it won't be.)    My only deviation from the recipe on the box was using 1% milk.  I didn't doctor it with extra ingredients or by adding vegetables, because I wanted to taste what it tasted like on its own.    It tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, the stuff that my mom occasionally fed us when we were kids.  The pasta was soft but not mushy. The cheese concoction tastes the same as the standard.    Not as good as my friend Meem's homemade - it's not even the same category - but DEFINITELY better than adequate as a comfort food from one's childhood.

Hence the noodly portion of this product is 50 percent cauliflower. Whether there are actual health benefits to ingesting heavily processed cauliflower as versus heavily processed wheat, in combination with heavily processed cheese-like topping, is not mine to say. (Kids I know who are exposed early and often to real vegetables seem to like them in their unprocessed state, and I'm sure that fresh veggies from a local farm are FAR healthier than any variant of laboratory rat food.)    But that said, there is room in the world for mac and cheese, and this product tastes like mac and cheese. There is a slight cauliflower aroma during the boiling of pasta phase, but the cheese-like topping combined with butter and milk completely eliminates any possible confusion with actual cauliflower.

It's a great add-in, as it provides quality nutrients and fiber with minimal changes in taste.  I have found though, that if you add too much of this vegetable, it does become noticeable.  And while I don't mind this myself, my kids notice and don't care for it.    So I was very excited when I discovered this product.  And when I made it as part of our dinner tonight, I was eager to see how it turned out.  Would it be worthy of the Kraft Blue Box?    While straining the pasta after cooking, I could detect the scent of cauliflower, but it wasn't intense.  The product cooked up the same as usual with no sign of any difference.    The taste was just fine.  My husband and I noticed a slight difference in taste, but we liked it.  My six-year old made no comment whatsoever, and we didn't tell him about the new ingredients.    The current price on Amazon puts this product at about $1.66 per box before shipping.  I usually pay less than a dollar for generic mac-n-cheese, but I've been buying it less and less in recent years because of the less healthy white pasta.  So while this product is a bit more expensive, I love the cauliflower feature.  I'll probably keep an eye out for online promotions or grocery store coupons, but I'd love to buy it in the future."

It also had more fat, cholesterol and I believe calories than the oritingal version. The cheese powder seems to be the exact same in both...which is really where the health improvements probably need to be made.  So, if you're choosing this over the original because it's ""healthier"", you may want to think again.    If you're buying it due to an allergy issue...then this might be a better choice.    My kids did prefer the taste of the veggie pasta over the original version.  They will eat both though so I predict future purchases will be based on which version is less expensive between these two and the whole wheat variety.  I already know my kids get enough vitamin C and iron each day.    I'm giving it four stars because they liked the taste.  I'm not giving it a fifth star because the inclusion of ""veggie"" on the label leads others to believe it's healthier than it really is."

My recommendation is to just stick to the regular mac & cheese products and have your veggies with it--it's going to be a lot better for you.  This wasn't a great dish, and far from a successful one.    Economically speaking, it has fewer servings in the box to deliver that half serving of vegetables, and by the time that half serving is shrunk even further by eating less of the entire box...there's not enough vegetables to matter."

Shipping arrived without any issues, no damage to the cans. Cans are kinda hard to open, compared to some other brands.  I immediately noticed that the oil tasted inferior to the olive oil used in their premium versions (this version uses soybean oil).  The sardines were acceptable quality, certainly not on par with their premium line, but certainly not bad.  The tasteless oil didnt help.  Sardines were packed in tight.  I would give the Sardines 3 Stars, if not for the fact that you get a great deal: 24 cans!  So 4 stars..barely.  I would've paid a little more to get better quality sardines in better oil."

It seems that buying 24 cans in warehouse packaging should be a better deal than this is offering to us. In addition my last two shipments were a bit less fish and more oil than the first ones. For those reasons I have dropped my earlier rating of 5 to 3 stars.    Incidentally, I never received a response from the company as to why the front of the can says 120gm and the box says 95gm.  ========================    In the words of that wonderful Tina Turner classic- ""Simply the Best.""    These are excellent in almost every way. Only the can itself could be improved.  I will admit that the container can be quite a challenge.  While it pops open easily, peeling the top gets progressively more difficult as you proceed.  It is nearly impossible to remove the lid entirely- and truly impossible to do so without ejecting  a bit of the oil from the can.  According to the packaging and can imprints, the sardines are caught wild and canned in Morocco. I think the containers might be made from abandoned WW II German tanks.    That said, it is well worth the struggle.  Every can of the original 24 was fully packed with 4 fairly large, tan in color sardines: skinless (there were perhaps three sardines in the 24  cans with the slightest trace of skin remaining) and absolutely no bone. The taste and texture are excellent.  I have never had any particular thrill from olive oil, so the fact that these are in soy oil (and filled to the brim) was no problem for me to say the least.  Lightly salted (for sardines). You will almost surely be consuming 100% of the can content.    This might not be the first choice of the top-tier of gourmet consumers (I am not one), but I can not imagine any sardine lover, nor many non-lovers, not being extremely pleased with this product.    This is truly a 5-star selection.    Note that while the front of the box says: ""Net Wt. 4.25 OZ (120g)""  the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box show it as 95g  which is 3.35 OZ  ===================  From the packaging:  Serving size 1 can (95g) Servings per container 1  Amount per serving: (% = % Daily Value)  Calories 220 Calories from Fat 130  Total Fat 14g (21%)   Saturated Fat 3g (17%)   Trans Fat 0g  Cholesterol 35mg (12%)  Sodium 360mg (15%)  Total Carbohydrate 0g  Protein 24g (48%)  Vitamin A 0%  Vitamin C 0%  Calcium 6%  Iron 10%  Contains 2g of Omega-3 Fatty Acids per serving  Ingredients: Sardines, Soy Bean Oil, Salt  =================="

I discovered the Country Choice line at my local Wegman's originally. Their prices are good, but I think Amazon has them beat for the Oatmeal Raisin cookies.    These cookies are individually wrapped. One cookie is a serving, at about 100 cals.    I like that the cookie is soft, and the raisins are soft and still moist.    I really like that the ingredients are organic.    They're good tasting to me, not too sweet, not too anything. Just right.    Along with their Vanilla Wafers, and Trader Joes' Almond Windmill cookies (and lately, their Southern Style Pecan cookies), these are definitely in my Top 5 Cookie list.    Give them a try by buying a single box locally ... then come back and get the mega pack from Amazon."

EVER.  *****review for Double Fudge Brownie flavor*****,"I actually feel awful giving a bad review to a product manufactured by a company that might be a small, independent operation, but... dang, these are bad.  I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're ""soft baked""), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.  (Nothing against weirdo hippies - they're great - it's just that sometimes their packaged food sucks.)    Bottom line... if I'm going to indulge, I'd rather eat crappy cookies filed with unpronounceable sludge from some evil multinational.  Truth is, sometimes hydrogenated & high-fructose tastes better.    P.S.  Despite the large photo on the large box, the cookies are quite small.  About 30% smaller than pictured.  Not cool."

Now, this isn't a meal replacement - it is kind of small so it won't fill you up. But the taste is really good and you can feel good eating it.  Not as sweet as many oatmeal cookies that you find, but you can definitely taste oatmeal and chocolate! I have these on SS. I think they are a good deal for the quality of the ingredients.

If you want a fairly large variety pack then I believe this is the way to go.  I received 42 k-cups- there were no more than 2 of a variety (both decaf and caf, and a wonderful half-caf...).  The bag is a small bonus- it is about the quality you'd expect based on the fact that it comes holding a bunch of k-cups (I actually really really like it)- not military grade but reasonably well made nonetheless.

One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.

I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else.

566629,B008ADQY68,A3OGYXV9S7MJHM,Rita Lonie,0,0,4,1342915200,If you like...,"So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.    So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. ""That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy."" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it."
566630,B001EQ4J1K,A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,Jim,14,16,5,1235692800,Great stuff!,"My daughter often had a Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) for breakfast when she was in high school, leading my wife and I to give her grief for not having a good breakfast.    Years later, when my aging father was ill and it was difficult to get him to eat as doctors said he should, a nurse recommended CIB, saying that it was a complete meal. Fortunately, my father loved it.    Since then at least two other nurses have mentioned it to me, and for the past several years I've been drinking it fairly regularly. Now, it's rare that a day goes by when I don't have CIB for one of my meals.    A major ice storm hit the rural area I live in recently, knocking out power, telephone, and even cellular service and water. Part of a tree in our front yard landed on the power line, and limbs of two tall trees fell onto our driveway, blocking our means of exit.    Fortunately we had a fresh box of CIB on hand (French Vanilla, our favorite flavor) and a gallon of milk (which we kept ""refrigerated"" by keeping it in a cooler outside where the temps were below freezing). After that experience I realized that having a supply of CIB plus some powdered milk and bottled water on hand was as important as having flashlights, a portable radio, batteries, candles, and matches, etc., in case of emergency.    I'm a big guy who likes to eat and who does a fair amount of physical labor, and a glass of CIB fills me up, gives me an energy boost, and keeps me satisfied till lunchtime (assuming I've had it in the morning; sometimes I have it for lunch instead).    When I travel by car to visit relatives out of state I carry a supply of CIB with me. They may offer me eggs and sausage or bacon, etc., for breakfast, but if I have my CIB and milk is available, that and a good cup of coffee are all I need. I've also gotten into the habit of carrying a thermos with a pre-mixed CIB drink in it when I go on such road trips, so that I can have that for a meal when I'm on the road instead of having a McDonald's meal. I have noticed that I stay more awake and alert throughout the 8 1/2 hour drive if I substitute a CIB for a McMeal, and don't feel a need to pull into a rest area for a nap as I usually do after eating a McMeal.    I swear by it and even though Amazon's price is only a few cents below what my local WalMart charges, getting CIB delivered to the door 3 boxes at a time is convenient and seems a good way to avoid ever getting low on it.    I like it blended with a banana too, and in hot weather blending CIB with a banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an extra special treat.    I have apologized to my daughter for giving her a hard time about her CIB breakfasts when she was in high school. When I tell her that at least 3 nurses have raved about CIB to me, she says, ""See? SEE? And you and mom gave me such a hard time, telling me it wasn't enough to have for breakfast! Grrrr!!"" ;-)"

They eventually returned the vanilla to the original recipe.  I use it mostly in protein shakes.  But I do like the occasional frozen mug with just the powder and cold milk.  Remember to put the powder in first.  Always leave enough room to stir vigorously.  Try really hard not to drink it all without coming up for air.  It's hard to do but you can do it.

The ONLY cons I can think of are:  1) Added sugar to an already sweet drink, has something like 18g per serving?  2) Can be hard to find and/or expensive (on a student budget, anyway)    But the pros much outweigh the cons for me.

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.    (From the Twinings website: ""When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name."")    Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley."

If you like your tea a little less potent, you can either let it steep a shorter period of time or use less tea thereby making the tin of tea leaves produce more cups of tea.    You also get the tea packaged in a tight fitting tin rather than a cardboard box so that the tea will stay fresh longer.  Stores in my shopping area do not carry loose teas so to be able to get a loose tea flavor I like that will give a nice robust flavor and be packaged in a tin container for freshness and convenience is a double win for me.

Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together.

The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.    I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.    As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.    The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".    Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best."

Results have been great! there is more odor immediately after the cat goes #2 but there is literally no on-going odor and the cats don't smell like chemicals after using the litter box. Much better for us and them. In addition, there is far less tracking (we use the non-clumping fp).

DO NOT buy the Van Ness sifting box, the holes are too big.    2)Scoop solids daily with a pellet-specific scoop like the one that comes with the Breeze.    3) Sift urine soaked sawdust to the bottom compartment by either shaking the box side to side or scooping the pellets around until the all the sawdust falls through to the bottom. I go with the latter because I don't feel like lifting it.    4) Enjoy the rest of your day not worrying about the litter box.    Remember to empty out the compartment with the sawdust every few days. I have 1 cat, so you may have to do it more often if you have multiple cats. I also keep the Breeze urine pads as lining in the lower part in case any urine trickles down and to absorb the smell of the sawdust."

I don't think that this is as hot as Insanity but it's been awhile and the internet searches all say that the ghost pepper is much hotter.  Maybe I am just advancing along my heat journey, but this doesn't seem to burn my skin/lips/mucous membrane as much as insanity sauce did.  I will be stocking up on more bottles of this sauce.  I put it on a drop at a time and then spread it with a knife.  I have found that it works best with a medium like BBQ, salsa, mustard.  You should put those on first since they are the vehicle to allow this to be spread evenly.  Otherwise the bread, tortilla, etc just soaks up the drops and you have uneven distribution."

Boy, did that set a standard! Forget jalapenos and so on. Then, as I read further about hot peppers, I came across references to ghost pepper. Habaneros are hot; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year. As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner, you get heat and they also support flavor.    I just got this product a week ago. I immediately used it with a pasta dish served at my place of employment. Two drops with the pasta--stirred so that the pepper sauce was spread evenly throughout the dish.    Oh, boy! A nice heat. After finishing my dish, there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth. The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish, but actually added an additional element. In addition, my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running. But a small price to pay!    This is a fine addition to my kitchen. I underdid the portion earlier today with an omelet, but I got it right with diced potatoes and onions for dinner. I am still learning, but I think that I will be routinely ordering this in the future as my current bottle is emptied."

Habanero and above is a requirement to eat at our table. So with that in mind, pay no attention to those who say that they are using this as rodent repellent and other rediculous applications. This hot sauce is hot but not unbearable. It is flavorful and goes well in many of our dishes. I put some on our holiday turkey and was impressed by the way it interacts. Now, for those that think you have to splash hot sauce on everything, you really are just wasting product. A spread over a wide surface with just enough sauce to colorize the surface is perfect. We are comparing this sauce to the Dave's Insanity sauce which is slightly less heat at the beginning but Insanity burns longer with more intensity than this one does. This one trails off after a few minutes but doesnt have the intensity at the beginning. Overall, we definitly like them both and I am going to go ahead and purchase Ultimate Insanity today to fill out the offerings at our table. Great product!"

It really only burns where it is directly contacting your mouth/toungue, and you wouldn't notice it as much if you mixed it in with something. If you do put it directly on your tongue it burns it until it is numb    The flavor is quite mediocre. Different than any hot sauce I've tasted personally, but not necessarily in a good way.    However, you'll note on the bottle that it is a good industrial cleaner and grease remove. And this is true.    I use it on all of my pots and pans when after I cook in them, and I use it to clean my bathroom. I also used it on my baby, but now I don't have a baby anymore.

My wife and I love hot food and can handle it hotter than most.  This stuff, however, is just ridiculous.  It really should come with a big, bold warning rather than being nestled unassumingly among the other hot sauces.  The taste is good but you can't have enough of it on anything to enjoy it.

Sure, it's hot but there are far more better alternatives out there, for one, 100% natural Blair's hot sauces (Mega death being the hottest from their standard line). This was actually the second one from package and I love it. Third one was ""West African VooDoo Juice"" that actually comes with handmade voodoo doll :), but besides that makes a great and original addition to your food and therefore deserves recommendation.

I was unimpressed with their habanero ""hot"" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat.    I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of ""Insanity++."" I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong.    I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals."

Initially, it was hot but certainly no hotter than other sauces I've had.  I quickly followed up with another dime sized dab on a chip.  Shortly thereafter, it began to feel as if my tongue was being electrocuted.  My eyes began to sting and my lips went numb.  The ecstasy brought about by eating spicy food poured up out of my mouth and into my head.  I laid down and the dog started to act very worried.  While prostrate, I focused on the pain and stared into the darkness of my own eyelids.  Every little thing becomes significant when the mind is seeking relief from pain.  I do not know what will happen when this stuff makes its way through my digestive tract.  I'll be eating more soon."
566782,B001PQTYN2,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B. Riley,32,34,4,1234742400,The Hottest of the Hot (for now),"It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina® Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"".    Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.    My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution."

After receiving this industrial solvent in the mail, I called some buddies over for burritos, beer and baseball.    Cut to fifteen minutes later: four men are sitting around, watching baseball and drinking beer as it dawns on them that there is an angry dragon writhing about in each of their stomachs.  The dragons breathe white hot fire that scorches their mouths and ravages their tongues.  Ever men, they remain erect and try to soothe the dragon's temper with gifts of alcohol. Quickly, though, the supply dwindles and furtive glances dart around the room.  Who will break first?  As sweat drips down their foreheads and stings their eyes, they try to think about baseball...think about baseball...think about baseball...and then one makes a break for it!  In an instant there is a stampede for the kitchen.  They fling open the refrigerator and, snorting like wild bulls, rip open another case and chug like Dionysus reborn--but to no avail.    This alcohol is fueling the fire and not dousing it.  With choked and gasping breath one whispers ""milk"".  Upending the kitchen they can find none of the sweet elixir.  With tears streaming down their faces they tear outside, but in the rush of flailing limbs they fall into a heap on the pavement.  ""Oh no"" they say, realizing the horrible truth.  In their haste to quench this insatiable heat they made a fatal mistake: they are way too drunk to drive.  Rising from the ground, they take off on foot for the nearest corner store.  Soon, none can bear to breathe through their mouths; the dragon's flames lick at their lips unbearably.  As they breathe heavily through their noses, their sinuses are soon aflame from the intense heat and begin their own form of self defense.    What a spectacle!  Four grown men with red faces, streaming eyes and snot flying into the wind as they gasp and wheeze down the road, driven by the fires of hell itself.    Soon, the fat one falls, hitting the ground hard but stretching his hands out for help.  Through the sneezing and wheezing no words can escape his ruined lips.  Onward the three friends push with nary a backward glance.  ""We will remember you fondly, fat one"" they say to themselves, hearts roasted free of compassion.    They burst into the corner store as one drunken, moaning entity of pure thirst and claw their way to the milk.  With wild abandon, they forego such modern niceties as payment and immediately pour gallons of soothing white mana into their gaping, flaming maws.  They sink to the floor in the silent thanks of men spared the gallows.  One thought lingers in their minds: ""that guac sure was tasty."""

Having tried Dave's Original Insanity and hearing all the campfire stories of the dreaded ghost pepper I decided to embark on a mystical journey and ordered a bottle of this.    The bottle was unassuming enough when it arrived. Standard shape, somewhat mundane label, but it contained a substance that had a curiously bright crimson and orange color. Once opened it had a spicy smell, not unlike Tobasco although thankfully without the overwhelmingly foul essence of vinegar.    Well, time for a taste. I got a good thick coat of the bright substance on my index finger and took the plunge. It had a pretty nice tangy flavor... That is it had a nice flavor for about 1500 milliseconds before Oppenheimer hit the red button and, ""I am become heat, the destroyer of digestive tracts.""    The heat hit me like a runaway freight train hitting a house of cards. No, make that a run away freight train with several JATOs attached to the rear propelling it somewhere above the upper class neighborhood of mach 2. I doubled over and let out a raspy gasp, my face flushed to a hue not unlike the sauce itself, my eyes became a water park. My aural senses became dull like I was at the bottom of a swimming pool.    I heard a knock at the door and stumbled towards it with blurred vision. It was a county sheriff at the door and he was there to serve me. My own tongue, esophagus, uvula, stomach, and intestinal tract had somehow just filed a class action lawsuit against me. I reeled backwards and fell onto the couch and tried to focus my bleary eyes on a small fuzzy object on the floor. It was my cat, standing quietly and observing my plight. Maybe it was the impaired vision, maybe it was the start of something more spiritual, but my cat's face warped into a Cheshire smile many times the girth of his face. Each tooth glowing with the luster of tarnished gold in an unholy candlelight. His eyes sank back into ashen voids, glimmering ember pin points at the center of each gaping socket. The room around him began to dance and spin and the walls eventually melted away to reveal a brimstone canyon stretching as far as could be imagined. ""Soooo hoooot it's spoooooky,"" my cat boomed, his voice echoed with a baritone bass that would surely send James Earl Jones running for the hills. Sweating, hyperventilating, and nearly blind, my vision finally faded to black.    I awoke with blinding light bombarding my face. How long was I out? Slowly gyrating figures came into focus and as my eyes adjusted more I recognized them as people standing over me. A few more moments and I was able to see one of the faces and... Grandpa?!    I bolted upright nearly headbutting the entire crowd looming over me ""Am I dead?!"" I shouted.    ""No, no. You just had a bit too much of the insanity sauce in one go, I'm afraid. You'll be back to the mortal world in a few moments,"" my grandpa stated non nonchalantly, adjusting his tie slightly.    ""So, wait,"" I began, ""Wha... what is this? ...Is this?""    ""Maybe,"" grandpa shrugged, ""Perhaps you can ask me again on your next visit in a day or two.""    ""Next visit?!"" I shouted, ""I'm not touching that sauce ever again! Except maybe per drop. Diluted in very large amounts of some sort of substrate like chilli. I-""    Grandpa smiled and interrupted, ""You only have a few seconds left. You'll be back at least once more, I know that for sure.""    ""For sure?"" I asked genuinely confused.    Grandpa tiled his head, looking at me like I had just grown a third eye, ""Well yeah. You already ate the stuff, and what goes in has to come out eventually.""    My face cracked and was painted with the same look a deer must have in the headlights of an approaching freight train that is powered by several JATO motors. Before I could seek further council I was grasped firmly by an unknown force and suddenly yanked away. The light got sucked into darkness and the roar of passing wind deafened me. I was falling.    Soon something came into focus, approaching fast. It was the ground, rushing to greet me with the eagerness of a freshman salesperson thinking they've identified an easy mark. I began screaming, as if that would help. My life didn't flash before my eyes, I didn't have any final profound thoughts, my whole head was filled with paralyzing unmitigated terror. Closer, closer, closer. The ground hurled itself towards me in excitement to say hello to my face with a big wet, red kiss. And just as I'm 1mm away from contact...    I jerk upright on my couch, back in my house. Sweaty and tongue numb, cat still sitting on the floor looking as plain as can be. I breathe a heavy sigh of relief, although doing so has a noticeable heat to it due to the remnants of the sauce. I hold my head in my hands and try to regain composure, reassuring myself it was just some weird dream brought on by everyday stress combined with the sudden shock of the ghost pepper sauce. My eyes drift around coming to rest on a stack of papers on the coffee table. Legal papers? I'm... I'm suing myself?    I've since been eating lots of cheese and chocolate hoping to stave off the inevitable second visit to Grandpa.    This sauce is hot. Really hot. Use a drop at a time in large volumes of other stuff that needs a bit of heat.    Pros: Ultra super mega hot. Nice bright, festive color - If HGTV did a makeover of Satan's house they'd probably paint the living room with this stuff for the color.  Cons: Flavor is made irrelevant due to the absurd level of heat. No stopper in the bottle's neck so be careful about pouring."

I am a lover of hot sauces and have heard about the nuclear qualities of the Ghost Pepper. I had heard that it needed 2 keys turned at the same time just to open the bottle.. The label claims it is a ""great industrial cleaner and grease remover"".. Bah, enough I said. I had made some Turkey chili previously and had some leftovers so what a great way to try this ""So hot it's spooky"" sauce. I put a tiny bit on my pinky and licked it off, immediately my lips,toungue and mouth were tingling. It tickled my fancy. After a few minutes I began to sweat and my face flushed a bit. Bah... No worries. My wife sampled a drop on the end of a toothpick and was burning up for almost an hour. I splashed a drop into my chili, stirred it and nothing. Felt no heat, dropped some more in.. stirred it and let it set, mmmm good heat... I went do put some more sauce in and a quarter sized glob ejaculated out. I stirred it, let it set and Holy Hell... What a difference. I instantly began sweating, my nose was dripping and my sinus cavity was conflagrated. I loved it. I ate more, it got worse. My hearing diminshed and my eyes were burning. I ate more chili, my esophagus burned. I kept on going, had some milk. I finished the bowl in about 20 mins. I felt like death. It hit my stomach and it felt like a WWF battle royal in there. I got dizzy, had to sit down.. I became soft spoken and started to burp a lot. The next 2 hours created so much bubbly gas that I farted about every 30 seconds, some so loud that it registered on the Richter scale. I felt better. I survived. I had to work the next day. I am a firefigher and am used to heat. I had to poop. I never felt more of a delightfully different burn coming out of me. I had 3 of these episodes in about an hour. Putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer would have helped quell the fire. I laughed, the guys on my shift laughed.     All in all, it's really a great tasting sauce with a lot of heat. Will I do this to myself again.. You bet your ass I will :)"
566786,B001PQTYN2,A2SI78R33PC5JR,JavaGuy147,7,7,5,1313452800,Dayum.,"This sauce is HOT. It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food, more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili (or for pranking your friends). Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot, it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency. I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia. Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable, but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity. Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!    Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick. This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something. Be warned!"

Does Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce capture the taste of the pepper?    I, for one, absolutely love the fruity, bright taste of the Habanero - yes, Habaneros are hot, but their taste is exquisite; capturing that taste, or complimenting it, in a hot sauce takes real skill. Now, to be honest, I'm not sure what the Bhut Jolokia tastes like in its raw state, as I have yet to have the opportunity to try it (though I am looking for just such an opportunity). I would assume this sauce does the job, considering the ingredient list:     * Naga Jolokia   * hot pepper extract   * salt   * vegetable oil   * roasted garlic pulp   * acetic acid    The thing that worried me is that second ingredient - ""hot pepper extract"" is, no doubt, capsaicin. I take issue with including it in this hot sauce, as it artificially raises the heat level. Why not allow the Bhut Jolokia stand on its own? Who cares if the resulting sauce doesn't melt my face off? ""The Source"" or the plethora of has-no-flavor-but-who-cares-because-its-insane-heat-impresses-people hot sauces can do that for me if I am looking for that kind of experience.    Overall, this sauce has a decent flavor if you can get past the distracting quantity of heat. I suppose I should have expected the company that gave us ""Dave's Insanity Sauce"" to miss the mark, since heat seems to be their only goal; none of ""Dave's Gourment"" sauces has ever impressed me with flavor, I shouldn't fault them for merely being consistent. :)"

Did I mention that it is a LINGERING heat?  This is a great sauce with a familiar, distinctive ""Dave's"" taste that leans a little more toward sweet (and away from bitter) than original ""Dave's"".  Personally I prefer this slight shift toward sweet with most foods on which I've tried the sauce.  This will not keep me from continuing to use the original on hotdogs, perogies, and chili, etc..."

All I need is one drop into whatever it is I am eating or cooking, and I am done. With other hot sauces, I would go through an entire bottle in a week. What made me a fan of Dave's hot sauces, is the smoky flavor that still comes through despite the heat.    My last bottle of Dave's original insanity sauce was running out, and I thought I'd give a different one a try. I decided on the Ghost Pepper hot sauce because it has good review and free shipping from Amazon. I received the shipment very fast, it almost feel like next day although I certainly did not pay for that option. I tried the hot sauce in a stew I made by just putting a couple of drops in my bowl. It's got good heat like the original, but I find the flavor lacking a little. It's got a different flavor that reminds me of a Louisiana style hot sauce, but not quite as tangy. It's just as hot, though I don't feel it's much hotter, than the original.    I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I will by buying another bottle of the original Dave's insanity hot sauce."

There's a pretentious part of me that likes being able to experience new tastes, tastes that the average person wouldn't even notice due to their excruciating tongue agony.  If I don't enjoy those flavors, then the whole exercise is pointless.    If you can handle it, this sauce *tastes good*, which is a rare treat among the ultra-hot sauces.  I would apply it liberally to many different dishes, if I didn't value my sanity so highly.    The experience differs from other sauces.  With other hot foods (even mild ones like jalape&ntilde;os), it's a pretty straightforward battle: it's spicy, I ate it, and now it's burning my mouth.  Then there's this sauce (and other ghost pepper-based foods), which is a whole different thing... instead of it burning me, it feels like *I'm* the one burning and I just didn't notice it until now.  It's a fun twist.    Word to the wise: this stuff builds up over time.  When the bottle first arrived, I put a tiny dot of it on a french fry just to check it out.  I tolerated that small amount with no problem, but it'll sneak up on you.  It started with a mild tingle, and built to a noticeable sting over the course of about five minutes.  If you forget this fact, you'll eat an enchilada with a bit of sauce on every bite and finish the meal feeling like a champ... only to be rendered speechless and near-catatonic ten minutes later.    I definitely recommend this sauce to anyone who *isn't* just in it for the bragging rights.  And for those who are: I've felt more burn than this, but not often and rarely from such small amounts of the ""active ingredient""."

One teaspoon in a bowl of chili is sufficient to release a torrent of endorphins and cause the eater to sweat profusely. After accidentally adding too much Ghost Sauce to one bowl of chili, my wife made me take a shower before she'd get close to me. It was as if nearly every pore in my body opened up and went into overdrive producing sweat.    Don't expect to get much flavor out of this sauce. It's all about heat. If you're looking for something that tastes great on its own, you'd best look elsewhere. But if it's heat your after, you've chosen the right product. I always add a good dose of Tabasco sauce for flavor, but Tabasco is pretty puny when it comes to setting my mouth on fire. Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce gets the job done!"

That was merely good storytelling rather than a truthful review of this sauce. The sauce has a very pleasant fruity tasty but not from any additives but rather from the natural taste of the ghost chili the main ingredient (although it has an odd smell like sweaty socks). Its no where near as hot as Dave's original insanity sauce. I can eat it a drop or two at a time on a corn chip or in a taco and the burn is moderate to hot but not crazy hot, whereas Dave's original insanity sauce would make a whole pot of chili burn with just a drop or two. This is one of my favorite sauces now. I bought a bottle a month ago and it is about 1/3 gone whereas Daves insanity lasted me years ( unless my tolerance is just growing ;-) ) Enjoy!!!"

I've noticed some of these reviews saying it tastes/smells nasty - I suspect a bad batch - because what I just had is really quite tasty. Its also very, very hot. I had a quarter sized dollop on a corn chip (after a couple smaller doses) - and its a really quite excellent 15 minutes burn - tears, sweat, red face and a nice endorphined finish. That being said, I've had raw habaneros that seemed hotter, and lasted longer (it's all pretty subjective). There were no hiccups, or that panicky feeling you sometimes get when you've had something ""way too hot"". It ramps up nicely, and crests at about 10 minutes; gone in 15. I suspect this stuff is some portion of the heat of a raw jolokia pepper, but not really on par with the real thing (hard to say since I've not yet had one). So, yeah, really great burn without being over the top. And its quite a nice hot sauce too - smoky and a little sweet. There may be hotter sauces out there, but this is just a good hot sauce, that happens to be face-meltingly hot, as well. In all actuality, as hot as ""edible"" gets - any hotter and you really wouldn't want it on a taco. Fun at parties, and highly recommended."

First, yes, it's hot. But it's hot for hot's sake: the sauce is really just a heat delivery system, without really bringing anything to the party in terms of flavor. It smells like it should have some of the smoky sweetness of a good jolokia sauce, but if you can actually pick up any distinctive flavors behind the wall of heat it generates in your mouth I'd be surprised.    Second, the texture of this sauce is just off. I know Dave's sauces tend to be thicker than most, but this is practically a paste. The thickness causes two major problems. The sauce is difficult to dose out, tending to either catch in the bottle's neck or plop out in large dollops well beyond what any reasonable person would want. Also, it's hard to distribute across your food.    Third, it's impractical. Something this hot and thick is far more useful as an ingredient than a condiment, but even when I'm making spicy food I seldom have need for anything this potent. I can't imagine using it on a slice of pizza or in scrambled eggs.    Sauces like Holy Jolokia and Naga Soreass will let you experience the subtle flavors that come with the intense heat of the pepper. Dave's Ghost Pepper just gives the heat, without really showcasing the pepper itself.    Get it for when you make large pots of chili or when you want to haze fraternity pledges. Otherwise, stick with thinner sauces that have some versatility."

Come to find out it is Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce. Being the connoisseur of spicy foods and sauces that I am, I couldn't help but chuckle inside at my co-workers. Using toothpicks to try hot sauce? Really? PANSIES! So I did the only logical thing, I had to show them up! I grabbed the bottle (before reading anything on the label), put a dime size drop on my hand, and promptly licked it off! The first few seconds were magical, Dave's sauce packs a wallop of flavors, however before I could even discern what flavors those were, my enjoyment quickly turned to ""Holy crap, that was a bad idea"". My tongue and lips were instantly on fire! Being use to many different spicy and fiery foods, I knew I would be ok, but since I was not expecting the tongue punching that I just received I was taken back. For the next 5 minutes or so my tongue was tingling and so was my poor lips, which by the way had an open wound from me biting down on it during dinner the night before. That's another story, but as you could imagine it did not help one bit! Anyways, this sauce is damn good and I immediately ordered some last night to add to my pantry.

As such, it does not surprise me that many people find this sauce TOO hot.  I do not.  It is perfect thus far.  My experiences in different foods follow.    First Taste : Drop on my finger : At first, great aroma and flavor.  Then, the heat started to build and hit max fairly quickly.  With other sauces I have found this means it will then die down, however Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce lingers.  The burn lasted a good long while (I would estimate 15-20 minutes, with pretty much a glass or 2 of water).    Chicken Alfredo : Afraid that the drop on my tongue was unrepresentative and the heat would de-intensify with food, I put on 4 or 5 drops to a medium bowl of Chicken Alfredo. This was a tad too much.  It didn't kill me, but wow did I drink several glasses of water.    Wendy's Chili : I loved this so much I picked up another bottle from a store nearby work that carried it and thought it would do well in Wendy's Chili (which is close by).  I put one drop first and tried.  Not quite enough.  I put another drop and it was perfect.  While Wendy's chili is certainly not the best, this hot sauce made it all that much better!    Hamburger : I purchased a Jalapeno burger patty from Stater Bros (local food chain).  2 drops mixed with other condiments (Chipoltle Mayo and Jalepeno Mustard) was perfect.  It added the desired amount of heat and flavor (did I mention this sauce has a fantastic flavor!?!?)    Chili Mac : Made with ground turkey.  Yep, this is a pretty low ball dish.  I meant to put 2 drops, but wound up with 1 drop and a dollop the equivalant of 3, so 4 total.  I'm not sure if I'm just building up resistance, but this was awesome.  It wasn't so hot as to have me sweating, but it was a definite (and enjoyable) battle to finish it!    I have tried all of the ""usual suspects"" (Tapatio, Trader Joe's Jabanero (which also isn't bad)) in addition to Melinda's Ghost Pepper Sauce, and this is my favorite by far due to both heat and flavor.  Melinda's has a fantastic flavor, but leaves much to be desired in the heat department.    Feel free to clue me in to great tasting hot (and hotter) sauces.  I have always been a fan of ""heat"", but now I am an addict (thanks to Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce!!!)."
566803,B001PQTYN2,A3A8S3C9FHPY3N,"Eric Marshall ""-Eric""",1,1,5,1331078400,New Favorite Sauce- Compared to Dave's original,"I like to think of the potent flavors found in Dave's line of sauces sort of like Stinky cheeses. Some people hate them, some people love them, and there is a lot of subjectivity so any review that regards the flavors or smells as good or bad must be taken with a grain of salt because it's all about personal preference. I'm not saying that Dave's sauces taste like foot cheese, just pointing out another ""food group"" that can pack some very pungent strong flavors and smells that some people find very repulsive. Dave sauces are thick with ingredient and not ""watered"" down or full of vinegar. They have a very strong smell and flavor that some people may not like. I think that like fancy cheeses, dark beers, or black coffee, powerful hot sauces like Dave's are an acquired taste that takes time to appreciate.    I find the Ghost pepper version here to lean sweeter and smokier than the original dave's by quite a bit and like both very much but for different reasons. Heat level is very hard to compare amongst things unless they are orders of magnitude different. The Ghost bottle has one more ""+"" next to the ""insanity"" rating than the original but I find that heat level ""ratings"" within an already very hot group of sauces are not very important since it really all comes down to how much capsicum is ingested and how much comes into contact with the sensitive parts of the mouth/throat. The long term cost of desiring a spicy hit at nearly every meal is actually lower with sauces in this category because they do the trick in small doses. My limit is about a teaspoon on a meal and that makes for a very powerful endorphin response that leaves me rather incapacitated for about a half hour after meal time. Usually use less than that but everyone once and awhile pepper heads feel the need to push limits and cause some real pain. I  have noticed that different sauces (made from different peppers) have different heat ""behaviors."" Some are a hard hitting short duration burn in the mouth and on lips, and some you can feel as a warm buzzing through the torso for hours after eating them. The extract used in Dave's sauces seems to be a pretty good blend of both of those attributes, but I would say that the ghost pepper adds a more drawn out, building style heat that effects the ""whole body"" rather than just the mouth more-so than the Original Dave's Insanity Sauce.    My bottle of Dave's Original Insanity was almost empty, so I picked this Ghost variant up at World Market as it would be a shame not to have another bottle of magma ready to go. I couldn't resist opening it right away and trying it out. The first experience with it left me wondering if I might have an allergy to it as it caused some sensations I had not felt with other sauces. The more I used it, the more I started to appreciate it's ""effects."" From my subjective point of view, it is the best flavor in any hot sauce I have ever had. I usually get bottles of various ""normal"" heat hot sauces (watered down habanero, jolepeno, chipotle, watered down cayenne) around the holidays from family members and most of them are enjoyable, but none can compare to this. I can only attribute the flavor to the Ghost pepper as no other sauce I have ever tried has has the particular flavor found in this sauce. The only ingredient that is ""out of the ordinary"" here to explain that is the Ghost peppers themselves.  If you've tasted the flavor of many pepper sauces and are looking for something ""new"" this has to be tried. The original Dave's insanity sauce contains a lot of pulverized, likely concentrated onion that gives it an addictive pungency that some would describe as ""smalling like something that should be used to strip paint."" The Ghost pepper variant does have a touch of garlic but does not come across to me as being anywhere near as pungent as the original (keep in mind, I liked the original, for the same sort of reason I suspect, that people take a liking to ""stinky"" powerful cheeses).    Oh yea... one final consideration... Be careful with it, it's pretty warm. I'd suggest against pranking people with it as there is some potential liability there that is not worth it IMO."
566804,B001PQTYN2,A77F7LYGRR41G,Derek Johnson,1,1,5,1330646400,"Dollar for dollar, simply the best","Kudos to Dave for bringing great taste and amazing heat together like this,  sure the heat is extract boosted, however, for the money, this sauce is the best deal out there, no close seconds.  This one sets the standard for hot sauces of this genre.    I've tried several hundred (maybe a thousand by now) and have been making my own sauces for over 4 years, I've grown several gardens dominated by Jolokia peppers and have made some pretty wicked all Jolokia pepper home brew versions; however, Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce is still very hard to beat.  His Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia ""select sauce"" is a notch better, but for the price of about 3 bottles of his select sauce, you can get a gallon of Jolokia pepper sauce, and this is the quantity that I get.    My favorite use of this sauce is to impress guests who think they can handle heat, mixing it with other commercial or homebrew sauces, putting a dab in ranch for salad, and eating it with just about everything except sweets or cereal.  I'll keep trying every hot sauce known to man leaving no stone unturned, creating my own with my own Jolokias, Habaneros (etc.), but you'll never catch me without plenty of this one around."

I am thinking that maybe people have different reactions to pepper types, because sauces with cayenne pepper, even if they are not as potent, seem ""hotter"" to me.    The other thing that leads me to think this is that I am not an experienced chilihead, and was careful about trying this sauce carefully.  A tiny droplet on a chip led to a great smoky initial taste, and a growing burn that topped out at hot, but very manageable.  This lead to more and more over the next day, and my comfort level tops out at a small pour into a cup of chili gives it nice taste and a solid burn that I can deal with, and I can still feel hours later- in a good way.    A fine sauce, I thought this 5 oz bottle would last forever, but I can already see that I will run out sooner than expected."

I can say that this is some insane stuff. I put sauce on everything that is not sweet (snack cakes, cake, cereal and things like such)but on eggs, toast and everything else I do. I make home made mayo and other things that I put sauce into, just so that you get the idea of the pepperhead that I am.    I just got done devouring home made wings that I fried, and coated myself. I separated my wifes wings, for she is 8 months pregnant with our daughter, and I commenced to take a challenge set by one of my co-workers. I drenched my 10 wings in Daves Naga Jolokia blended hot sauce, not off of his Insanity line. Totally separate, and full of it's own unique flavor, I took the challenge!    9 wings later, I saw a glass of milk that my pregnant wife was drinking so she would not get heartburn, I devoured the glass, and followed it up with a beer. I was fine after 5 to 10 minutes, and I won't say that I was in pain, just that I give respect to a sauce blended for only one drop. But I will say that 10 is not far away.    Definitely not today though!"

I dipped a toothpick in the bottle and wiped it on two slices of pizza and the first senation I got was ""wow nice roasted garlic taste"" and no sooner then I realize my mouth is on fire and im sweating. I had the hiccups for 30 minutes and I love spicy food."
566808,B001PQTYN2,A3J1NV9I9PHCRU,Roman736,1,1,4,1320278400,Kick to it,"I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a ""hottest sauce"" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:    The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.    What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.    So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.    So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.    If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again."
566809,B001PQTYN2,A1UK936HX3BZQR,Bobo_Du_Hobo,1,1,4,1318982400,It's certainly hot sauce.,"I got used to it pretty quickly, so it gets used more like ketchup now, but it really doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from other sauces. It leaves a burn more on the lips than the throat, and gives a whole new meaning to the term ""ring of fire"" about a day later."
566810,B001PQTYN2,A34EPHORR7MQH4,rxonmymind,1,1,4,1306108800,"Fire,Heat & slow burn","My initial impression of Dave's once opened was this sauce stinks. Sorry Dave! I just went down to the kitchen to smell it again and it does have a smokey,spicey woody smell to it. Had this with grilled stired eggplant and as a testament to this sauce, it didn't destroy the flavor of the mellow eggplant stirfry. Be careful when pouring as this bottle doesn't have a restrictor. But it does come out thick and pours slow enough. Had porkchops on the side & this sauce seemed to bypass the actual food & leave you with the heat in back of the throat. Not the most flavorful hot sauce but appropriate for chilli, Crock pot stews and the like. Also, I like hot sauces to be done soon after dinner. This, you will feel long after dinner is finished in your esophagus, stomach ect. It almost wears out it's welcome. Having said that, Dave's is a definately a HEAT multiplier for food. The best HEAT sauce I've ever tasted. Cheers!"
566811,B001PQTYN2,ABMUKNMMLXM66,JAC,1,1,5,1306022400,Wow!,"All the other sauces were hot, but we wanted to try this one.  We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce (about a cup of wing sauce).  This is powerful, using as directed is a must.  We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce.  9 drops are perfect for us.  This most definitely has a heat and kick of it's own kind.  If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot, this is for you...but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small."
566812,B001PQTYN2,A11AVMDWF6B94Z,Alex,1,1,4,1302825600,This stuff is dangerous.,So I got this stuff Wednesday afternoon just in time for lunch. I used about a teardrop amount on my food and have to admit i was on the verge of sweating. Taste could be better but this stuff is hot! Be careful not to leave this stuff lying around the house though. My pops came home from work that same night and mistakened this for regular hot sauce. He doused his food with this stuff and got one bite before realizing something was wrong. He was in a lot of stomach pain (enough to bring him to the floor) and sweating as if he'd ran a marathon. Now there's a danger label on it that i personally made.
566813,B001PQTYN2,AR38UO36XB7MR,"Larry D. LaForce ""Techno Junkie""",1,1,5,1302393600,Proceed with caution!,"Was at a market (World Cost Plus?)and came across this. There was another brand too, Melinda's or Meranda's...something, yeah. I decided to go with this one as the other had carrots and mango puree and other stuff (blah). I'm sure this is too make it not so hot but I figured this might cover up it's natural taste too.    So I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home. Figured start with something mild and got a ranchero chicken soft taco. Put one drop of this stuff and smeared it around. Not bad. Complimented it nicely. Second was a meximelt. One drop only again. This time it seemed they merged together and boosted each others spices. By the time I was done I had a nice long heat going and some sweats which lasted untill I got home.    You know when you take a shot of hard liquor on an empty stomach? That burn? Imagine that burn slooooowly moving through your system. Yeah, it' like that. I'm sure it will kill any parasites living in your intestinal tract. Might even remove any bubble gum you swallowed as a kid.    Next day, tried it again, this time on a burger. Threw some ranch on it and tried 2 drops this time. Got to my second burger and knew if I did 2 drops again that I might be in trouble, so went with only 1 drop.    1 or 2 drops per item seems to be the right amount. Pouring this stuff on like it was Tapatio WILL without a doubt lead to problems!! But I will be taking this to work for all those Tapatio junkies and others who just eat raw chilis straight up. Hehe, let's see if they think they're still macho now, huh?!! This stuff is deceiving! Seems fine at first, but man o man, that heat will catch up and bite you! I have bought the habanero version of Tabasco and didn't care for it. That was mainly vinegar with way too much of a black pepper type taste. It is hot, but I ended up throwing that away. This however, I definetly will be buying more of!!! It may overpower your food if you use too much of it, but for most part it merges with your food and creates a new flavor. Those who said it tasted bad or metallic must have had a bad batch.    By the way, me, i'm not....well wasn't a big chili person untill recently. I used that mild sauce (aka ""weak sauce"") up untill a few years ago. So I haven't trained myself into eating stuff as hot as this. Pretty much an average guy with a growing interest for new things : )    update: finally did try that Melinda's version of Naja. Did not care for it at all! It had a very quick bite to it and too much of that pepper extract taste (even though it isn't loaded with extract). Sadly the Melinda's is sitting the fridge, barely touched.....but my Dave's is almost done."

If I go to an Asian restaurant, I'm the guy who asks for spicyness at a level 4/5 or 5/5.  Ok.. now that we have that taken care of:  this stuff is HOT.    How hot you ask?  If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue, there is noticeable heat.  When it comes time to eat a meal, I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat.  The stuff is no joke.  If you use it like Frank's Red Hot, you will probably die.  100 percent recommended if you like things HOT."

566817,B001PQTYN2,A2HCZT0AO77KZT,James,3,4,5,1309996800,Yeah it is hot,"I came home tonight and was ecstatic to see this arrived.  I put hot sauce on pretty much everything and habanero started to loose its umph some time ago.  After preparing some spaghetti, I turned the bottle upside down and tried to shake the paste-like sauce into my bowl.  Excited, I began to smack the bottle.  I probably knocked 6-7 drops into my bowl.  Then I read the bottle, which belatedly instructed me to use one drop.  About 4-5 mins into dinner it hit me; my lips went numb and I began to sweat.  Shortly thereafter my nose began to run.  I went a little bit lighter on the next bowl- like 3 drops.  This was still extremely hot- I continued to sweat and became a little dizzy.  I don't see this stuff bringing a grown man down.  However, it is a half hour later and I think that I am high.  I am also afraid of what tomorrow might bring.  Although this is a must have for those who like hot sauce, you should seriously be weary... it is indeed hot!"
566818,B001PQTYN2,A3J3CDYXQ60Q48,NeciFiX,3,4,5,1284681600,Death in a Glass Bottle,"Alright.    I'm just a sixteen, almost seventeen year old kid. High School Student, bored and wanting to buy some cool stuff. I tend to blow all of my money on cool internet stuff... I figured hot sauce was the next best route to take. I've tried a lot of neat stuff from cool organic pills that change bitter foods to sweet and insane prank sprays, but, I figured this would be my next step in the process.    Wow. Just wow. I bought this stuff last week and it arrived this Friday, after picking it up with a good friend of mine, Brandon, at the post office, we headed home. I opened the package and we both vastly underestimated this product. He took a lot of this stuff. A lot. Probably a good-sized spoonful, at once. He was crying. A sheen of sweat covered his face as he fell on the kitchen floor, panting. Water, milk, bread, nothing worked. It was pure agony. He is a spicy fan, so, I was surprised to see this from him. Hesitant myself, as I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, I tried it. I saw the darkness. My left ear felt like it was about to explode and there was a trail of fire leading down my esophagus.    I began to stumble around my kitchen, grabbing popsicles and milk and water. I had vastly underestimated the potential of this sauce. It is the destroyer of worlds. I'm not experienced with this stuff, but, my friend is, and it is the hottest thing he's ever had by miles. This stuff is 400x hotter than tabasco sauce on the Scoville scale.    I invited my friends Rob, Matt and Cyrus over. Rob barely had a dab and nearly died, Matt took a small amount on a spoon and then downed a glass of milk and said ""That's nothing"" and smirked, then, a moment later, began swearing and freaking out, grabbing his bottle of fruit juice he brought over and chugging it. Cyrus began to cry and pant heavily. This stuff is amazing. Simply amazing. I added one good sized drop to some tomato soup I made for dinner, as well as a lot of other delicious spices (I'm great at makin'  the stuff) and it really added a lot of flavor and a good amount of heat without making it overbearing.    This sauce tastes really good and, as long as you aren't making your friends eat the stuff straight out to witness their horrified reactions, it will last an extremely long time. Do not drink this stuff straight out of the bottle without putting it on some sort of food. Trust me, unless you're looking for a kick, this is not a joke. This stuff is insane, I guess that's why it says ""INSANE++"" on the bottle. To quote Rob, ""It's not hot anymore... IT JUST HURTS!!"" Careful with this stuff!"
566819,B001PQTYN2,A2ZLMN5XY0E4TM,Brandon Welch,3,4,5,1281916800,Holy god of Fire.,"This stuff is ungodly hot. I tried it out with a Baltimore City cop and we were on our knees for 10 minutes, He said it was almost as bad as pepper spray and this was from a tooth-pick dab straight. My little brother screamed and I had eye sweats, serious pain followed by drug like euphoria.    Now, if you use it like food and put on or in something, it is much more manageable.    This bottle will end up living in many people's fridges forever, but it works great as a heat source for chili and is very tasty on chicken. If you just use it to harm your friends as a party trick, that's fine, but it has a nice flavor when consumed with a little restraint.    The ""real deal"", seriously hot enough for any purpose, will probably keep deer out of your garden."

It wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it but i'm sure if I had more than that dab I'd be in for more than I could handle. The sensation from the dab lasted a good 15 minutes.    The sauce contains the ghost pepper, hot pepper extract, salt, vegetable oil, roasted garlic pulps and acetic acid. It's a delicious addition to many foods- especially sauces, meat and ethnic foods. Not for people with heart/respiratory problems.    Amazon has the best price i've seen on the sauce so far.

I had used about 1/3 of the bottle so I knew what I was getting myself into. I must have not realized that the oil was too hot to add liquid to without causing it to vaporize. Instantly after pouring it in it began to boil violently. A sizeable cloud of Dave's hot sauce quickly formed above the pan. I thought it would be OK at first. I backed off after getting a small whiff of it. It was very potent--like mace. After about 25 seconds I couldn't stop coughing but I continued cooking thinking that just the small whiff had gotten into the wrong place in my throat and I would soon return to normal. Little did I know that it's vapors were spreading throughout the house. Within minutes my roommates were coughing across the house. My dog was also wheezing.  After opening all the windows and doors in the house and turning some fans on I ate my egg/vegetable patty sandwich. Even with no visible signs of Dave's hot sauce left in the pan it was still very hot, to my liking.  This sauce should be used with caution. When consumed the wrong way it is very unpleasant."

I just tried the sauce again for the second time today and I'm even more disappointed now.  After reading all the stories people posted here, I seriously thought this was it, but this is far from being ""it"".  I cannot and will not claim, like most of you, that I can handle the hottest of the hot sauces, but this I will say with all honesty: this sauce is a DISAPPOINTMENT!

I'll focus on what jumped out at me in particular. First off, when you open up the bottle (after shaking it to death, just like you should on all extract sauces) you notice an aroma distinctly vinegar, with naga fruitieness and a hint of garlic. The taste is just amazing! You can't even taste the extract over the powerful naga sweetness. The one area you will surely notice the extract is in your stomach. Never use this stuff on an already empty stomach, best to prime the pumps. Even an iron gut may fall pray to uncontrollable stomach cramps. And yes, this stuff is pretty hot. Way to hot for most people in fact, even though I was only able to make my bottle last a week (did I mention that I eat whole naga jolokia peppers with no liquid or food?). So if you are able to finish your bottle in a week email me at ... we'll get together and get our heads checked."

I have the 5oz. bottle at home and have nearly consumed it in that time, and also keep a smaller bottle (obtained from the 4-pack gift crate) at work.  The odor/flavor is reminiscent of Tabasco, but with a level of bite that would grab ANYBODY's notice.    First, I should say that I never use this directly as a food topping, but instead blend it into a sauce of one sort or another.  I practically live off of Bird's Eye Lightly Sauced vegetables (one of which is a penne in alfredo sauce, another is rigatoni/vegetables in tomato parmesan), and this stuff complements them nicely.  Cut a hole in the bag, pour a liberal dose in, and shake the bag up until the contents are thoroughly mixed.  In the case of the alfredo sauce, I enjoy the heat at the point where the sauce has taken to a light orange tinge, but mileage may vary.  It mixes nicely with ketchup as well.  I would recommend a 1:10 ratio between the hot sauce and whatever base you're combining it with, but this is purely a matter of preference.    I would only assume that if you're reading this, you already know the heat that a ghost pepper packs, and if you want scare stories feel free to read the other reviews.  If what you want is a good way to [literally] spice up any dish, though, I think you need look no further.  Carry an emergency bottle for trips to places that promise spicy food but fail to deliver."

I imagine the lack of flow control on the bottle is to make up for the thickness of the sauce, but it really seems like this sauce is made for idiots to suffer on youtube.    I dipped my finger in and gave it a try, and what I found was a pretty disgusting sauce. It has a very bitter taste, unlike any other sauces I've tried.

It showed up packaged nicely in big thick bubble wrap contained within an innocent-looking plain shipping box.  Didn't know it had arrived until I checked my tracking status through amazon and seen that it had delivered.  Went out to the mailbox a little bit ago and brought it in.  Not sure how long it was out there, but I think it was partially frozen (current outside temp is 10 degrees).  However - frozen or not - this stuff means business.    I actually hesitated for a bit before breaking the plastic seal and opening the bottle.  Tried telling myself that I may as well let it thaw before opening - yet I think I was just stalling.  For better or worse, though, I decided to open it up and give it a try.  Using a small narrow measuring spoon (1/8 teaspoon I believe) I put a small dab of this lava-colored stuff on the end of the spoon.  Hesitated for a bit longer before placing spoon in my mouth and seeing what it was all about.  It took roughly 1 second before my tongue gave me that info in short order.    Immediate taste was very pleasant with a taste of its own for this particular pepper sauce.  I am by no means a 'chili head' or enjoy eating a lot of hot sauce with my food, but I can say that I did enjoy the flavor more than tobasco or habanero sauce.  However, the flavor was almost immediately dwarfed by an intense burning sensation on my tongue which made its way down my throat.  After about a minute or so the burning was in full effect with sinuses cleared and my complete undivided attention directed toward pain management.  Call me a wuss, but I ended up going for a glass of milk about 3 or 4 minutes after tasting a very small dab of this stuff.  It's truly amazing how fast milk can provide nearly instant relief from this type of pain.  Nearly an hour later and my tongue still has a slight burning sensation lingering where initial contact was made.    Use with caution.  As others have stated - the bottle does not have a regulator cap.  Mine had a thick consistency which was probably due to it being partially frozen.  But even at a very cold temperature, this hot sauce will seem like a gift from Prometheus himself."

I got a chance to try this one when I visited my uncle that had just bought a bottle. He told me how he had pranked several people at work with it and they thought it way very very hot. He didn't think so himself. After trying it myself I can say it's hot enough. Up there with a bottle of habanero. See thing is after a chili is as hot as a habanero you really don't need anything hotter. If you pour more than a teaspoon at a time you are asking for trouble/pain. Just a single drop was enough to get my eyes to water and tongue to burn all over. I was disappointed that it didn't get hotter over time since I saw some other people reviewing this chili where they said it got hotter over time and burned all the way down to their stomach.

Despite their taste and healthier attributes, these cookies suffer from the same flaws that are evident in similar goods. Once a box of cookies is opened, it's important to place them in an airtight container, otherwise they harden quickly.

I'd never mistake it for a real cookie, and it also fell apart while trying to eat it, given how thick it was, and the fact that the ""dough"" or ""batter"" (if you might even call it that) couldnt stick together due to the ingredients being too healthy.

They look just like the picture on the box, they are so soft and chewy and the taste is delicious. They come in a vacume sealed package so I suggest once you open them you place the entire package minus the box in a gallon sized zip lock bag because they will go stale quickly. I experienced this when my hubby was ""sleep walking"" and opened up the box and placed the package back in the box and the next morning they were all hard and stale. We ended up eating them over the course of a couple days with milk/coffee and dunking them. Another way I store them is in a air tight container I picked up at the doller store and placed each cookie in a sandwich bag and placed them in the jar. That way when I'm packing the hubby's lunch I just grab a cookie in its sandwich bag and throw it into his lunch pale. I mention my husband alot because he constantly talks about these cookies to his friends, we had one of them come over the other day and he ran over to the jar and had him try one. His friend was HOOKED now he is also a loyal customer as is his wife. We don't really care for the raisin variety which is sad because I typically love raisin cookies. If I were you I'd just order this flavor.  Oh I also forgot to mention that I have also heated one up in the microwave for about 8 seconds and since it's already a soft cookie it makes it so crumbly that you can imagine it just came out of an oven!

I'm quite sure Kashi makes a pretty penny on their products because of their image. Not everything Kashi makes though is worth the money. These cookies are an exception though. They are sort of a treat--I wouldn't eat them every day. But when you do eat one you feel like you ate something substantial.    The ones amazon sent had a full six months before their expiration date, which is plenty. I agree though that this is one product that truly loses a lot of quality as they get too old. I guess that means they aren't packed full of preservatives, though I'm sure they have some.    In short, if you like dark chocolate and oatmeal then I'm pretty sure you'd like these cookies."

If I'm getting a craving for something sweet, I can go for one of these and feel totally satisfied. Only 8g of sugar per cookie, and 5g of fat which is a tad higher than I would have liked but I would guess if they had cut more fat out they would have sacrificed a lot of the taste. The cookies are a little smaller than I was expecting, and like others have previously said they are kind of dry, but neither factor really bothers me. Bottom line: ditch the Chips Ahoy and Oreo cookies and try these instead. Wonderful alternative, and I personally think that $8.99 for three boxes was a pretty good deal."

Her brother, who's a chef, recommended it.  I went to 4 different stores looking for it. It never dissapoints. If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan. I bake everything at 375, covered, for an hour, or until I see it's done, then uncover it to let it brown...best chicken, ever! And the seasoning is kosher, so it's perfect for Shabbos chicken.  This week I put fingerling potatoes and sliced onions in the bottom of the pan, tossed them with a little garlic powder, olive oil, salt and pepper, then put chicken on top and seasoned like I mentioned above, letting some of the rotisserie seasoning fall on the potatoes....it was wonderful!"

Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores.    A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine:  Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee.  The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.    I used to buy Illy at the local stores, but the prices were over $11 per can, sometimes $12. I was happy to see Amazon start carrying it at an even lower price.

I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso.

Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores.    A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine: Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee. The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.    If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy."

The espresso is foamy, smooth, has a wonderful body and just plain delicious.

Anyway, if you have struggled to find the perfect coffee, as I have, look no further.  In my opinion, this is the most consistantly delicious coffee I've ever had. It comes pressurized in nitrogen I believe, to assure it's freshness.  It is very potent, as the fine grind is intended for use in an espresso maker.

I personally liked Lavazza taste better.    Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty.

They lack the fat of popcorn (except for the air popped corn which is not worth the effort).  They have a certain richness from baking, a taste which ties it right back to the beer from which it derived its malty goodness.  These pretzels are great in another way: you can only eat so much at any one sitting.  They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.  My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels.  The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.  If you chomp into a whole pretzel, you will discover that you had dental problems that you never knew you had.  So, better not 'test' yourself and just give them a satisfying and productive bash in the bag before eating.  Enjoy..."

I previously bought K-cups on a regular basis, but due to constant price increases that luxury has ended for me.    What I discovered:  - this twin pack lasted me 5 weeks (equal to 105 K-cups at 3 cups per day X 35 days)  - I paid $13.99 (K-cup boxes would have cost me $59.98 at $29.99 per box X 2)  - the flavor was fabulous, just like the K-cups  - you can control strength by choosing more or less coffee in the Ekobrew (I fill to the max)    I'm very happy now! I can still use my Keurig, get a great cup of coffee, for 1/4th of the k-cup price.  Sure, it takes me a little longer to make coffee, then rinse out the Ekobrew, but this is still much quicker than using the old auto-drip type coffee maker.    Price notes:  - NEVER ever pay more than $8.99 per 12oz bag!  - I paid $6.99 for ""Starbucks Italian Roast"" at Kroger (on sale)(my favorite coffee!)  - I paid $4.50 for ""Caribou Mahogany"" at Publix (buy one, get one free deal)  - Dunkin' Donuts coffee costs LESS at Dunkin' Donuts than Amazon    In our struggling economy, there are ways to save money with only minor sacrifices.

I grew up preferring Strawberry, then Vanilla, and, lastly, chocolate.    Then when I was 35, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Switzerland. What a treat that was! Lining the main boulevards were small confectionery shops filled with cocholates the likes of which I had never, ever laid eyes upon. A tiny box of chocolates that would be about 5 inches square and hold 12 pieces of candy cost around $30. But I had no idea that Chocolate could taste so exquistely good or look so beautiful. Little candies with 3 layers of chocolate in various flavors topped with small green candy looking twigs, or hearts, or diamond shapes.  Truffles made with plain chocolate or all different types of liquors. If I could have afforded it, I would have eaten myself into the size of a blimp. And the sales people were so delightful, always reminding me that this box was made Today and was meant to be eaten TODAY or it would get stale. I thought about our boxes of chocolate that sit on the shelves for weeks or months and winced. Thankfully, lots of walking was required to see the sights and I was able to eat what I could afford and still not gain! It was like Heaven.    But then, back to the States we came. Hersheys just didn't cut it anymore. So I began taste testing what I could find locally always recalling the vendors' words ""that chocolate was made today and is to be eatenn today."" I tried Truffles, I tried mixed boxes whose photos made them LOOK LIKE the insides of the tiny little boxes in Switzerland. But nothing measured up.    One day, I was in a local store and sighted these Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. It was my turn to bring treats to a group I go to on Thursdays. The chocolates were on sale and I had noted that the Belgian chocolates I had tried did seem fresher than the others, and tasted better than other brands shipped in Stateside. So I bought two boxes and trooped off to my meeting.    As Soon as I had put the chocolate out, I checked to make sure that no one else had brought chocolate as a treat. Nope. Then I took one and ambled away to give them a taste. I wanted to make certain I hadn't bought something awful. So with my back turned to the group, I tried out a piece. I popped the whole thing in my mouth and went through my usualy routine for checking chocolate. I let the piece of candy just lay on my tongue for about 25 seconds until it had softened up and then began lightly and politely sucking on the chocolate. Oh my. It was fresh and had a delightful sweet chocolate taste very similar to the Swiss Chocolate I so loved. In fact, this was just a bit creamier. With little time to spare, I went ahead and bit into the piece expecting solid chocolate. But no, there was a soft inner core of ever sweeter, softer, creamier, fresher, chocolate in the center. I was Delightfully Surprised. Hating to hurry, I went ahead and chewed the piece up so that I could join the group.    But my what an experience. I found myself going back to the counter several times during the afternoon, to get another piece of that chocolate I had brought. I urged the others to try it and each one was also very impressed with this chocolate. Where DID you get these? Were they terribly expensive? How long do they keep? Can I put them in my candy jar or will they melt? The SeaShells were an overwhelming success. I shared that I got them at the local pharmacy on the corner, that they were currently on sale, best to eat them as soon as possible, but they will keep in the freezer without problem for a year, and, yes you should be able to keep them in the candy jar as it was then winter here in Arizona, but I would not put them in a jar during the summer. I have found that even with air conditioning, delicate chocolate does not hold up well out of its box when it is hot. Somehow the candies sense the outside heat and their insides get really old and stale and melt. Ugh. Best to keep them in the fridge in the summer. If you buy them on sale as a gift, stick them in the freezer to preserve them like new.    I am amazed at how good these are and I do pick them up on sale and pop them in the freezer for gifts, and keep them hidden in the fridge as a treat for myself. They are indeed, the best ""other country, Stateside Product"" I have found. Whatever theis company does is amazing because these tender candies stay fresh and edible for those of us here. So, I highly Recommend them as they are my favorites. I would NOT order them in the summer or when it starts to get warmish at all as they will probably melt in transit unless they are shipped in dry ice, which I do not know. But I only have them shipped in the dead of winter because it can get so warm here at any time.    So, If you are a candy eater, and love foreighn chocolates, then get some of these. They are a wonderful treat. I hope you like them as well as I do.!"

But after TASTING these yummy morsels, we knew that these were the BEST chocolate ANYWHERE -- on sale, or not!    A few years later, my sister came to visit.  We bought some more Gulian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. (don't remember if they were on sale then or not), in honour of her visit.  She took ONE bite of one....and summed up what my mom and I had thought ever since WE had first tasted them:      ""...I can't believe how good they are!""    .......................................................    THE REAL REASONS WHY THESE CHOCOLATES ARE S_O GOOD Dept.    Many years after her visit, I was watching The History Channel, and they mentioned Belgian chocolate, and showing how it was made.  I remember the voice-over saying that Belgian chocolate is even better than French chocolate -- and giving the reasons for this.  1) Belgian chocolates are made from the freshest of the most fresh ingredients.  2) Belgian chocolates are made by people who take IMMENSE PRIDE in their profession, and want to make sure everything is JUST right!    .....................................................    FALSE ECONOMY.....DON'T GET STUCK LIKE I DID!! Dept.    I recently made the mistake of trying to find a ""Belgian Chocolate Bargain"" on Amazon.  Believe it or not, it was an 11-pound BLOCK of Dark Belgian chocolate.  WORST culinary mistake I ever bought, (I won't mention my home-made kitchen disasters here.) The greater the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate, you see.  I don't know if it was mentioned or not....but I probably would have bought this anyway, so delighted am I with BELGIAN chocolate.  I wound up with something SO huge, and SO hard, that I was lucky a friend of mine's husband was able to break it into twelve smaller blocks -- with his home-workshop SAW!  He didn't dare break it into slices, because this could have BROKEN his saw!  So I am left with 12 blocks of approximately 1 1/2"" x 2"" x 3"", that I will probaby have to grate, then powder in my blender.  IF, that is, I don't get disgusted enough to throw the whole thing out.  Sadly, these hard BLOCKS of Belgian chocolate are no longer fresh....or that tasty, either..........    ...................................................    THE ( YUMMY! ) BOTTOM LINE:    So, for a treat, DON'T look for a super-bargain....even in Belgian Chocolates.  Save money by fore-swearing pizza for a few months, or other such economies.  GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA-SHELLS, (here in the 8.82 ounce ""REGULAR economy"" pack), offers bite-size morsels of true confectionary ART!  They are better than ANY chocolate you have ever tasted -- unless you have tasted Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells before!  Give them to anyone you appreciate and admire....including yourself.  And you, (or whomever you give them to), will surely echo my sister's words:      "".....I can't believe how good they are!"""

In terms of the chocolate quality - I thought it was good.  Guylian shells are definitely not something you'll confuse with fresh Belgian pralines.  I'm assuming the freshness issue accounts for the difference in taste between these and something like Corne Toison D'Or in Brussels, or any one of the really good Belgian chocolate-makers whose products are flown here from Belgium and sold immediately or disposed of so that customers only get freshly-made chocolates.    Providing one understands these are made economically to survive on the shelf, and are not to be compared to the amazing, delectable but quickly-spoiled types for which one either goes to Brussels or pays a fortune in shipping, I think these make a great, relatively inexpensive chocolate."

567138,B0000D9MYO,A3ID40LCZO3RVU,Orlando,4,5,1,1326844800,Not the taste of Hass,"I want to return my recent purchase of Olivado Avocado oil. The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.    Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them. ""Natural Zing you ripped me off"". I am out $15.  and am very upset.  Sincerely,"

I have no idea why I didn't hop on this avocado oil train long ago but I just discovered it at Whole Foods.  This takes salads and meals to a whole other taste level.    I try to have a monounsaturated fat at every meal due to the health benefits and the scores of studies as well as personal experience showing they assist in weight loss when combined with a regular proper calorie diet. (These are the good fats) so I include lots of avocados and olive oil in my diet naturally....I'll make salads, pastas, hummus, tapanades for sandwiches, combine beans and corn with avocados etc, make a california veggie burger cooked in olive oil and topped with avocados, red peppers, etc in a pita...so replacing my olive oil with avocado oil has brought on wonderful new flavors.    That said, with culinary training under my belt, I'm exceptional at picking out individual flavors in foods and I taste olive oil as a component here as well.  This is made by olivado which I'm assuming is likely an olive oil company by the name so it could simply be they are using the same presses to press out the avocados.  It isn't something that bothers me as I love olive oil, but it gives the avocado flavor a milder taste so I'm anxious to try some other brands as well.    I personally feel this is an oil everyone should have on hand.  The flavor is a whole new depth when using oil that is unique and unexpected and I'll always have some, no matter what brand, in my own cabinet. I find myself reaching for this to replace other oils in recipes very often."

Once added to the tarka (tempering)along with a few other spices, these leaves immediately give off a strong yet aromatic citrus like aroma. Although most commonly used in curries, leaves from the curry tree can be used in many other dishes to add flavor. In Cambodia, Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roasted it to a crunch and crushed it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. These leaves are NOT related to curry powder and you should purchase these fresh not dried for the best flavor for your dishes. Although it is nit advised to store these in the refrigerator, I have found that if wrapped properly in several paper towels then placed in a ziploc bag, they do last for a few days and up to a week.

Price is high and 1 can lasts only 4 days.  Manufactured in England.  Comparable American made product called Elecare, just as good, slightly better price, but if you go to the Neocate manufacterer website and call their customer service you can request your first sample can free.  Good product for infants with milk protien allergies.  We were concerned about strange colored soiled diaper and pediatrician tested it and came up positive for blood in stool.  Doc started us on elemental formulas first.  Two are widely available.  Similac Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen.  Enfamil adds DHA to their formula in an attempt to make it more comparable to breast milk but our infant couldn't digest it and passed it as a thick yellow paste.  If you sign up at Similac website they will mail you samples of their other formulas but also several coupons for $5 off any of their formulas which really helped offset the cost.  Be prepared though.  All of these smell horrid and taste nasty as a powder, not as bad once mixed with water.  Fortunately infant tastebuds are not as developed. Baby still had a lot of reflux and gas even when we tried adding every colic remedy/gripe water on the market, which also drove up our feeding costs.  Pediatrician warned these rememdies are good for occassinal not chronic use.  So we stepped up to the Neocate.  After making my first purchase on Amazon, I got bolder and started poking around ebay.  Occasionally finding a better price but be sure to check shipping charges.  Some people make it look like they are selling it cheaper and jack up their shipping charges .  And there is all the drama, bidding wars and you can get sucked in just like in gambling so set your price point and stick to it.  A newer better offer is born daily. Sellers are not as reliable as Amazon and don't always package product well enough to prevent cans from denting.

I have seen some ppl post very negative remarks on here & think some may be exaggerating just a bit & some may not really know what to expect from a drink like this...nothing wrong with that just dont be so dramatic about it really. One thing I have found a GREAT use for this with is Jamba Juice now sells frozen packs of it tops selling smoothies in stores now, so I like to buy my favorite Mango a go go & use the mango/peach coconut juice to blend the smoothie instead of using the apple juice that it calls for...you could use any of the vita water favors to mix with any of the flavors. Instead of hating something try mixing it with something else & finding ways to create a healthy drink. Bottom line I love it."

I think the mango just does not compliment the peach, BUT, it's still good and appears to be healthy and has a reasonable amount of calories.  It was between a 3 and 4 for me so I rounded up to 4.    It's light and refreshing, like water with mango, peach, and coconut flavor added. It doesn't taste phony either. It is 100% natural and it tastes natural. Too good to be just flavored water. It tastes more like a light fruit juice.  I had mine chilled. It is imported from Brazil. A plastic twist-off cap allows you to stick in a straw easily, without hammering the package to punch it through. A single package is about 6 inches high, with 3 inch diagonal square shape.    One paper coated package contains 17 fluid ounces, marked as 2 servings. Per serving stats are 60 calories (so 120 calories total per package), 0 fat, 0 cholesterol, 30mg sodium, 500 mg potassium, 15g sugar, 4 % calcium, 4 % phosphorus, 175 % vitamin C, 8 % magnesium. Ingredients, as listed in order on package are: natural coconut water, mango puree, peach puree, ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The package states it is 100 % natural, has more electrolytes than leading sports drinks with 15 times the potassium, and has more potassium than 2 bananas.    So--- it is good, refreshing, healthy, easily packable, and easily openable. (It's ok. I can make up words. I work for the government.) I really like the high potassium content, too. (Note--I am NOT a doctor.) As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out. Anyway, this is good and it sure tastes a lot better to me than Gatoraid (yuk). So, check it out, and read up on ""potassium"" before the heat gets here."

I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).

The bread collapsed in the baking process...I'd never had that happen with all the breads I have made.  Taste was not what I was expecting. I tried it again and added honey, butter and about a quarter cup of water.  The result was a nice flavored, white sandwich bread...certainly better than frozen store bought breads.    I am not sold on this product as the cost is substantially higher than other products.

It doesn't contain any nasties and the recipe for making anything is incredibly simple (contents of the packet plus salt and two cups of warm water). Adding small quantities of other ingredients (butter, sugar, sorghum flour, buckwheat flour, etc etc) improves the flavour, but they're not essential.    And bread machines are a waste of time - just mix the ingredients, knead a little and place in a bread tin to rise and then bake without opening the oven door."

I was skeptical the first time I made it because the ingredient list is short, and you only add like two things to it...water and oil I think.  Figured it would be either the best or the worst bread ever.  I mix mine in the bread machine (as I don't have an upright mixer) and then make it into rolls using the directions on the box.  He prefers the rolls to making a loaf, and tends to eat more of it.  It's worth noting that you can vary the size of the rolls considerably, and I find that making 12 is about the right size and consistency for sandwiches/munching on.  Much bigger and it's just too much to eat.  The package doesn't tell you how many it yields, so this is from my trial and error.    As someone who doesn't have to eat GF, but often does by default, this bread doesn't have a weird aftertaste, like so many breads with tapioca starch in them.  Also, the texture, if not overcooked, is the most like ""real"" bread to anything we've tried.  Personally, I also like Gluten Free Panty's Favorite Sandwich bread mix, but my hubby prefers Schar."

I made this mix in my Zoji breadmaker, following the instructions on the box (and using the Basic setting, which is 3:30).  However, I found that once the mix began to knead, it was quite dry so I added appx. a 1/4c more lukewarm water.  I think it could have used more though, but it was my first time making this. The bread began to rise nicely but at some point during the bake cycle it deflated a bit.  I've never had that happen with any other recipes/mixes before.  The end result was a very crusty, crumbly bread with a rubbery texture.  My kids thought it tasted very plain.  I think I'll stick with Pamela's - never had a bad loaf with her mix."

This bread is great and also makes a fantastic pizza crust, it doesn't have the strong aftertaste that some of the GF breads have.  I've never used a breadmaker, always make it by hand, I wear latex gloves to mix it so my hands don't get gluey, I follow the instructions exactly, and it has come out fine every time.  I preheat/warm the oven to 150 or so degrees for 5-10 mins before I start the dough, then shut off the oven.  Spray Pam in the bowl and on top of the dough, cover the bowl and dough with a wet towel, and let it rise in warmed oven.  After risen an hour I then wear gloves again, cover a pizza pan with E.V. flavored olive oil, and spread the dough as thin as possible in the pan because it will rise when baked.  If anyone would like to see what the final pizza looks like I have it posted on Facebook under Gluten free Professionals group.  I also freeze unused dough, take it out the night before, and it makes great bread, rolls, or pizza and the dough is even more workable when it's cold.  Been using Schar for years without a problem, I have a feeling the folks had trouble due to the breadmakers, I work the dough by hand with gloves and it only takes a few minutes.  Remember the ingredients need to be lukewarm for the yeast.  I also plan to make onion bread and maybe olive bread with the Schar mix.  I have also make a spinach pie roll with this dough, spread it out, layer sauted fresh spinach and pepperoni and provolone cheese, roll it up, and bake, it's great.  I have also made sauted Calzones, and fried dough (doughboys) which are fantastic with a bit of sugar, just saute in a bit of olive oil in a nonstick pan and the dough fluffs up great and they taste fantastic.  I bought and baked every bread mix on the market to determine which was best and Schar came out ahead of all closest to real bread than any others, Schar also has a great website with good tips on cooking gluten free and baking bread."

After many unsuccessful attempts to recreate my favorite bread recipes using mixtures of various flour types, I decided to go the boxed route to see how things stacked up. Schar products have me hooked! I made the white bread last night and it turned out better than any of the others we've tried and don't come across as too heavy on any one type of flour. I do not recommend using a bread machine for the mix. Why? It's a simple matter to throw the ingredients in a mixer and they don't require any fancy treatment. Pat the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan, stick it someplace warm with a wet towel over it and wait. That's probably the most important thing... It doesn't give a time on the box, it just says ""until doubled"". Give it time... Took over an hour for me, but it was a bit cooler in the house than it probably would have liked. Baked it for exactly the time mentioned on the box and placed the loaf pan on a cookie sheet filled with water. Loaf came out looking like it might be under-cooked, but it wasn't!

The bread gets a nice crust and pretty good flavor.    When I make my bread, I'm more successful in the oven rather than the bread maker.  It's absolutely key that you put a pyrex of water in the rack under the bread pan when you bake this bread - otherwise you get a pretty tough and dry crust.  Be sure to put the pyrex in the oven when you preheat the oven. That way when the bread dough goes in, the oven is already humid.  Obviously you can't do that in the bread maker - so oven is the only way to go.    I have also found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of water gives the bread a bit more volume.  I also add 2 tbls of honey - this is not much in terms of sweetness, but it does mellow out any unusual flavors that are always found in GF bread.    If you're new to GF, this a great bread to try."

I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...    Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!    The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked."

Believe me, it would have to be for me to make it!    It's pretty good following the package directions, but what really made it fantastic was adding a full additional cup of water to the recipe, as recommended by one of the other reviewers. (This brings the total to 3 cups of water.)    Following the package directions, you really need to eat this bread the day you bake it (so make sure you make it in the morning!). Fortunately, this has not been a problem at my house. Adding the extra cup of water, it was still edible the next day.    I did put the bread in the oven to rise for 30 minutes, with the oven temperature set at ""warm"".    -------------------    Since writing the above, I purchased a bread machine. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU"">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a>    After 5 or 6 trial-and-error attempts, all moderately successful, I have cracked the code to making this bread mix work optimally in this machine. Here it is:    Instead of putting the wet ingredients in first (as the machine's booklet instructs), put the DRY ingredients in first, then the wet ingredients. Use the settings:    1 Basic  1 1/2 pound loaf  Dark crust    While following the directions (of the machine) will work, following my directions leads to bread that rises half again as high. This yields a fluffier texture which, frankly, tastes less gluten-free. (You know what I'm talking about!) The individual slices of bread are then so huge that you can literally cut one in half and make a decent-size PBJ."

We'll worry about everything imaginable, like if it will even get there and or what it's condition will be when it does get there. And when it comes to flowers, how long will they last? Well, I finally talked myself to take a chance and send these Orchids and I am really glad I did. I sent these to my inlaws in Kansas who we haven't been able to visit for a while, because of health reasons, and we got a call five days later from a very happy Mom. She told us that the flowers were perfect and that they would send us a picture in a few days so that we could see how beautiful thay were. Sure enough three days later we received an e-mail thanking us along with a picture of the orchids, and they were right, the flowers were beautiful and you could see in the picture that only half of the buds had bloomed and that along with the other half, they would probably last an other week. So, yes I am very happy I decided to send these flowers, not only because it made my inlaws happy but also because we now know where to buy our next gift of flowers to send."

I think the regular and triple cheese varieties don't have much flavor but this one totally has a unique flavor and it is great.  I saw it at Walmart during a shopping trip and hadn't tired it so I decided to give it a go.  I bought a few White Cheddars and a few of the originals.  After having a White Cheddar, I had wished I didn't buy the regular ones and that I had only gotten all White Cheddar.  It has such an awesome unique flavor, I am in love!  I went back to Walmart a couple weeks later and they were out of it.  I have gone back 5 or so times since and they either don't carry it anymore or are always out, totally bums me out.  Luckily, I found it online and can not wait until it shows up.  Apparently some don't like this flavor according to a few reviews but hey, I love it so if you haven't tried it, definitely give it a go yourself before believing the haters."

For shame, Kraft. This particular variety of Easy Mac is by far the worst abomination to come to the planet Earth since...since White Cheddar Easy Mac. Yes, nothing is worse than this flavor. It is like pouring granulated bits of aluminum and chalk into your depressing boiling hot bowl of noodles and then putting aluminum and chalk in your mouth.    Me eating Easy Mac usually ends in tears, but this was actually so terrible I threw it out immediately and went to get a hoagie, because, God damn it, sometimes you have to just say ""NO!

Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.    Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.    I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.    All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.    Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?  They're one of the best light, crunchy treats I've found and they're incredibly tasty.  I love 'em!"

There are no buffers or packaging materials in the box, with only the apple chip bags in there.  Thus, half of my chips were really just crumbs.

Tilda simply tastes wonderful, cooks quickly, and is perfectly long and fluffy every time. It is simply superior rice. No need for a rice cooker, either. I thought I'd tried them all, and I do ""good rice"" with regular long grain, but Tilda makes it effortless. I don't want to do without it, now."

Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

Each bottle came individually wrapped, with enough packing material to ensure safe delivery.    I used the Cabernet and Herb Grill Marinade with a pot roast, letting it simmer all day in the slow cooker until my family was ready to eat. Everybody loved it to the point where they had seconds. The Spicy Zinfandel Barbecue Sauce had more kick than we expected . . . a bit too much. Because of this, I plan on using half the bottle the next time I use this sauce for my chicken. I have yet to try it on burgers or steaks.    The portabella had a good flavor. I used it for chicken and plan to use it again for a pot roast or burgers. The only marinade we haven't tried yet was the Chardonnay Chipotle. Given how spicy the Zinfandel was, I plan on using this sparingly.    I recommend this marinade pack to anyone who enjoys rich, flavorful marinades. These are the best I've found so far."

567529,B003JO0VV2,AWG9MM2IQ4CQA,"Greg Johnson ""Thorgrym""",34,35,5,1292889600,Enjoying Wholesome Kefir,"Since I began following <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425204138"">The Maker's Diet</a> in order to improve my health, I have been interested in adding kefir as regular part of my daily nutrition.  Sadly, all of the kefir that I have been able to find is both low-fat and pasteurized.  As well, many varieties have undesirable additives (fructose, preservatives, etc.).  Recently, I have been reading more information about the benefits of kefir, so I began to look for a way to make my own.  I am already drinking raw milk from a local farm and have been making yogurt from that, so making kefir seemed like a good idea.  A health food store that I frequent sells kefir starter but it requires that the milk be heated first (according to the directions on the package) - essentially pasteurizing the milk and negating all of the benefits of raw milk in the process.  My search brought me to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>.  At first, I was a little put off by the price.  When I learned that the kefir grains can be used indefinitely with proper care and feeding, I decided to place my order.    When I received my package of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>, I was a little concerned by the condition.  The box was shipped in a cardboard 'sleeve' that had been crushed.  The product box was considerably flatter than it should have been, but the small, sealed 'envelope' containing the dried kefir grains inside was unharmed.  My suggestion would be to revise the packaging or choose a better shipping carton to prevent/minimize any potential damage.  That said, the damage was purely cosmetic.    When my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> arrived, I immediately set to reading the included instructions.  While I was a little dismayed at having to wait a week (or more) for the grains to be revitalized (by putting them in fresh milk daily until they are ready), I was eager to start enjoying homemade kefir!  I wasn't entirely positive if the grains were fully ready after 7 days, so I gave it another 3 days.  Even though the instructions say to start with smaller quantities of milk (about 8 oz.) for the first batch of kefir and stepping up to the desired amount, I made my first batch out of a full quart.  It came out great!    I am currently making my 4th batch.  To store the grains between batches, I simply put them in a jar with about 6 oz. of milk stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days until I am ready to make a new batch.    If you are looking to enjoy the health benefits of homemade kefir, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> by Cultures for Health.  Be patient - it is worth the wait."
567530,B003JO0VV2,A2SKTULD32YR6A,A J M,16,16,5,1296518400,Excellent value,"I spent a considerable amount of money buying kefir from WholeFoods (at $3.99 a quart) until I discovered these miraculous grains. Who knew kefir could be made at home so easily?! The insert with the small package of minuscule ""grains"" is a bit intimidating and you may think there is some difficult process to be followed. But it's so easy. Just place the grains in a cup of milk and put it on a shelf in the kitchen. Pour out the milk (just not the grains) and pour in fresh milk every 24 hours. For the first 2-3 days as the grains start stretching out their legs, growing their muscles, pushing and shoving each other, the kefir may be watery or bitter at first. After a couple of days, you start to get sweet-tasting coagulated kefir every 24 hours or so. You will save and save so much you won't know what to do with your money."

It also had (& still has) their name on it as ""by Cultures of Health LLC"" but then further down is says ""Ships from and sold by Lifetime Kefir.""  I just want to clarify for everyone out there, who like me thought I was buying from a specific COMPANY that sells milk kefir, that this is not sold through Cultures for Health & it is not sponsored or affiliated with them in any way.  I contacted Cultures for Health today and the customer service lady said that they are not affiliated with this ""Lifetime Kefir"". I also received my kefir grains in a plastic baggie & wrapped in about 5 more plastic baggies, all smooshed up flat, and looking nothing like the cauliflower looking kefir grains you see pictures of.  Needless to say I was a little freaked out.

I also sent the seller a question after working with and growing my kefir for about 2 or 3 days and he gave me a quick, polite, fairly thorough answer. Customer service seemed just good ... and quick.  I started with making about 1c of kefir and it was fizzy, clumpy/watery, weird.  I didn't know what I was supposed to be looking for but I guess this is normal and I just kept working with it each day changing the milk out and making new kefir.  It took about 1-2 weeks before it was producing well and I was making good kefir (not fizzy, but creamy now).  I was slowly figuring out how to work with the product.  I now make a quart jar of kefir daily.  I switch out the grains/kefir each morning and am left with about 3-4 cups of kefir each day.

There is nothing bad to say at all about the customer service with this seller, in my opinion.  He seems to go out of the way to make sure the buyer is fully satisfied with the product.

That is all from about 1T of smooshy, yellow looking 'stuff' (kefir grains) that I initially got from the seller.  It took a couple weeks for them to start working ""normally"" and looking more ""normal"" but just give them some time and they seem to come through and make great kefir.  The only reason for less than 5 stars is simply because I feel like there still is a little misleading advertising in the product.  It appears this seller (Lifetime Kefir) has a few different kefir grain ads/products on amazon & the one that I bought from ([...]) shows that it is ""by: Cultures for Health, LLC"" and ""shipped and sold by Lifetime Kefir"".  I thought I was buying the grains from Culture for Health through a middle-man, so to speak.  When actually it is not a Cultures for Health product at all.  Maybe no big deal to others, but it was for me.  It ended up being a great product in the end though."

Within 4 days, my little kefir grains started reliably producing unfathomably delicious kefir that is foamier, thicker, and infinitely better than the stuff my local co-op was gouging me for.    It sets up, at least in my toasty casa, in under 12 hours. Left longer than that, it turns into horse sweat cheese. I keep it in the fridge until I am running low, and then bring it to room temp and let it work its magic."

What I  received is a business sized envelope with a badly copied  letter telling me: 1. feed them milk daily - it will take 4  to 6 weeks to get Grains. 2. A fraction of an ounce of some  milky looking substance that  was squashed flat by the mail  canceling machine.  3.

567536,B003JO0VV2,A3SBGVCOIV8F0Y,G. Shank,5,5,1,1336780800,"Very small quantity, poor growth","I got these dehydrated kefir grains two weeks ago. When re-hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains. I put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature (our house is cool at night) and was very careful, and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains, or just going yeasty. And they're growing very, very slowly. Two weeks later and I have a half teaspoon of grains. So far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir. In desperation I started adding some kefir powder and kefir, thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria. Also, the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to ""rehydrate"". What you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir. I'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea. But at the very least they ought to give you enough of them, instead of the tiny amount.    Because it didn't seem like it was working very well, I ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor. They arrived yesterday, and I put them in milk. Today I think I have almost a quarter cup of grains. They seem to have already grown noticeably.    Out of curiosity I'm still going to try to get these grains to work. I'm going to try a much smaller amount of milk so the kefir grains aren't overwhelmed. I'll update this review if it ever works."

I am a first-time user of Kefir and until recently had never even heard of it. In a quest to achieve optimal health, I came across information about the benefits of cultured milk products, like kefir, in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967089735"">Nourishing Traditions:  The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats</a> by Sally Fallon. I was a bit nervous to use this product without actually ""seeing"" how it was done, so I went to the ""Cultures for Health"" website to watch the video. It was exactly the support I needed to have the confidence to start something that seemed so foreign!    The first day I began to hydrate my grains, I mixed a cup of whole raw milk and the kefir grains in a canning jar with a coffee filter fixed to the top with a rubber band. The weather outside was very cold and subsequently it was pretty chilly on the inside of the house too, so I turned my oven light on and place the jar as far away from the light as possible and closed the door. I repeated this process the 2nd and 3rd day, but by the 4th day decided to leave it on the counter since the milk was separating to curds and whey by the end of the 24 hr period. I had kefir by day 5! It tasted clean and a little like buttermilk, yummy! I'm still learning, but feel confident that I'm off to a great start, thanks to Cultures for Health <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>!    I'm thrilled to have this product! I save money by not having to buy powders, and my homemade kefir is better for my family than the pasteurized, sugar-filled, store-bought (expensive) version!"

The milk kefir that they produce is not what I would consider real milk kefir. I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn ""Kefirlady"" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the ""slimy"" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that. Personally, I'd recommend getting them from a different vendor as these are woefully inadequate at accomplishing their intended purpose. Looks like I'll have to be getting some new grains..."

The milk kefir grains from CFH were great, and my child thoroughly enjoyed the milk kefir. I noticed a calming effect from it (likely the B Vitamins). They helped with our gut and regularity immensely.    However, this is NOT a Cultures for Health company product. It is from 'Lifetime kefir."" I've never written a review before, and I do buy items very frequently online. I'm usually easy going with how things turn out through the mail. It arrived VERY warm and wet and in a PLASTIC bag. The dried kefir is much more shelf-stable through the mail and arrives in better packaging that doesn't leach chemicals into the product. Shipping was much slower than expected. It ended up shipping separately from my other items and arrived several days after the others. This is questionable whether it is safe to use because of the heat (it's summer here!) and plastic, and I certainly cannot give this to my small immune-compromised child of which is why I ordered this in the first place. For the customer service, I cannot yet say how they handled this issue, but I'm hoping for a full refund, shipping cost in all. I will update on the customer service aspect. Order directly from CFH.

They all seem to have good flavors, good ingredients, and they don't have as high of calories as some of the others do.    Cinnamon Coffee Cake really did taste like a cinnamon coffee cake.  It was pleasantly sweet, with that hint of spice from the cinnamon, and there was a little bit of sweet frosting stuff drizzled on top too.  It definitely had the crunch as well from the different grains the bar was made up of.  And I liked the crunch, it really made it feel like you were biting into something substantial.    The ingredients are good in this bar.  Not the best out of all the brands out there, but still reasonably decent.  The main sweetener is Brown Rice Syrup, but there is also crystalline fructose and evaporated can juice crystals.  The grains are the Kashi seven grain blend that they like to advertise and there's wheat bran and a few other things included as well.  There are some hard to pronounce ingredients, but these appear to be the vitamins.    This bar has 160 calories in it.  Not as much as some but still not enough to justify eating these as a snack.  Use them for when you're exercising, or don't have enough time for a full breakfast.  There is 5 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein as well.  Although there are 13 grams of sugar, which seems a little high.  I do have to say that eating one of these bars does not make me as full as other bars do.  I started getting hungry around ten am after eating the bar at 8 am.  But it still did ok in that aspect, and maybe I was just hungrier than usual.

Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.  If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar.

I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.

The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!    Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery)."

567686,B005K4Q68Q,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,187,216,3,1325808000,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.    Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.    That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.    Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).    There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.    My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.    So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.    Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.    UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.    UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.    I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.    So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.    43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."

Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.    But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.    I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!

I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!    Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.

Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.

I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home.

I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.    They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.    I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.

Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.    Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.    As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK"">Splenda</a>"" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.    ""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.    The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.    The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!    I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.    Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)    It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)    If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products."

While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.    I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only."

Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).    One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some."

If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa.

You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.

We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).

Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he/she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories.

It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.  My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.    UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.  Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.

We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.

It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.

This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.    The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.    I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.    For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.    Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).    The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation."

I put in enough vegetables to serve 2 people.    Then cooked 2 salmon fillets in a frying pan w/ olive oil on the bottom at low heat for 8 minutes w/ the lid on frying pan.  Cooked the salmon w/ the skin on the bottom touching the frying pan.    Once Salmon and veggies were cooked, put vegetables and yellow curry sauce in a big bowl, and gently placed the salmon fillet on top (took skin off after being cooked thoroughly). Garnished with Cilantro and squeezed a little lime juice in for extra kick.    Very delicious and fast and easy to do.

It comes in a plastic tub with an inner sealed bag so it should stay fresh longer if it is not opened right away. The flavor was more multidimensional than some other curry pastes we have tried. The heat level was just about right for us (we like some heat but not enough to overpower other flavors - the tongue should tingle a bit but not go numb). We still start with some chopped onions and sometimes add more ginger paste but the yellow curry is pretty good right out of the tub. The recipe on the tub suggests 50 grams of paste. We checked with a scale and 1 tablespoon is roughly 25 g (so 2 tablespoons of paste). We like it with a bit less - one and a half tablespoons for the given recipe otherwise it was too hot. We were quite happy with this product and would order again.

I prefer the smaller size bottle (400ml) because it fits better in my fridge door.    It says ketchup on the bottle but it nothing like ketchup or the spicy ketchups you can find at the regular shops. You just have to try it for yourself to decide whether you like it or not.    The sauce goes well on fried or grilled potatoes but it is also very nice on your bratz or other grilled meats & poultry. Mix it up with some mayonaise and you will get mayonaise with a kick.

Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.    I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.    There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.    Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.    You know what?

So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.    The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.    So again, not bad, but nothing special.

I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and ""Oh my God"", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.    Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.  Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the ""ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"", to make this more cost effective.    The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.

So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.    The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.    So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right."

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...  In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!    In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.  When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!  Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)  Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!    * Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.    The Colombian was the Best of the lot.    Read my comments, after each bullet item:      * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about    2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.   * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,    so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.   * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!   * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?   * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.    * There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!

The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.

I recently began using Salmon in the pouch and really like how convenient it is to use and it taste great. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.    The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.    Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others."

All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do ""roast"" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!"

I was puzzled by the one negative review, which is a verbatim repeat of a critical review submitted a month earlier by the same writer for a different product -- the ""roasted"" piquillos.

This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.    I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).    OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.    I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there."
568250,B00374ZKQ0,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,Chandler,38,45,1,1320192000,You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.,"First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.    While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.    I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).    But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW    Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.    But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?    Huh-uh.    You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.  You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.    Superb huh?    Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.    Not so fast.    I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.    So that got me thinking...    I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.  It is 1.75 ounces.  I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!    WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.    And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.    But, wait...one more thing...    Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...    It wouldn't surprise me.    Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't."

I love this stuff.  I've tried all the major stevia brands (including everything at Whole Foods), and Stevia in the Raw (which Whole Foods doesn't carry, sadly) is the only brand that doesn't taste like crap.  All other brands have a heavy bitter-licorice aftertaste.  Stevia in the Raw is unique in that I can put the powder itself to my tongue without grimacing.  I can't even do that with ""normal"" (i.e. toxic) sweeteners like NutraSweet or Equal (though Splenda tastes fine raw.)  I suppose I have a somewhat sensitive palate, and with the heavy amounts of sweetener I use, I can still detect a slight aftertaste even with Stevia in the Raw -- so if you're a heavy user with a sensitive palate, then just combine it with some erythritol and you're good to go.  No aftertaste whatsoever with that combo.  And this is way better for you than any other (palatable) sweetener."

NO FUNKY AFTERTASTE!!!,"I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.    A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).    I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!    If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been. Yay - finally a stevia I like."

I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.    To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda."

I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.

Search the web on inulin (not insulin!) -- it is being touted as a wonderful probiotic ingredient.  And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.    The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.    The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.    If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.  Taste is fine, but I wish I had gotten the chocolate so that I could get my choco fix on at the same time."

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.    Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!    I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)"

Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.    All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!"

Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.    Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home."

The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.    The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.

Little stars has just basic food ingredients without any preservatives and food coloring.  Sweet potato flavor also did not make my hand smell like dog food."
